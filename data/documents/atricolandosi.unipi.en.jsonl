TOLC @ CASA-I: Test carried out remotely at home, organized by one of the authorized offices, according to the procedures and calendar published on the CISIA website.\n2. TOLC-I: Test carried out in person (in the university classrooms) in one of the authorized locations, according to the procedures and calendar published on the CISIA website.\nThe TOLC-I can be taken several times, in any case the result of the test with the highest score in the Mathematics section will be considered valid for the purposes of selection, carried out starting from 1 January 2018 by the session deadline. The TOLC-I results are acquired automatically by the university.\nA merit ranking will be formulated based on the score of the\nMathematics section + 1/30\nof the sum of the scores obtained in the section of Logic, Science, Verbal Comprehension.\nThe tests will consist of a multiple choice test with a total number of 50 questions, each with several possible answers, one of which is correct, divided into several sections:\n\u2022 Mathematics \u2013 20 questions \u2013 time available: 50 minutes\n\u2022 Logic \u2013 10 questions \u2013 time available: 20 minutes\n\u2022 Science \u2013 10 questions \u2013 time available: 20 minutes\n\u2022 Verbal comprehension \u2013 10 questions \u2013 time available: 20 minutes\nFor each question, it is assigned:\n\u2022 1 point for each correct answer;\n\u2022 minus 0.25 (- 0.25) points for each wrong answer;\n\u2022 0 points for each omitted answer.\nIn the event of a tie, the candidate will prevail who has, in order:\nthe higher total score;\nthe highest number of correct answers in the Mathematics section;\nyounger by birth.\nThose enrolled in the selection who have not taken the TOLC-I will not be included in the ranking.\nFor the first and the second sessions, candidates are eligible for admission if they have obtained a minimum score of 8 points in the Mathematics section.

We recommend students to take all the test sections that will help for self-evaluation and find specific skill gaps.\nA successful test outcome allows the enrollment without Additional Learning Requirements (Obblighi Formativi Aggiuntivi \u2013 OFA).\nTherefore, if failing a TOLC-I test, the School of Engineering provides a recovery 10-lesson Mathematics course called \u201c\nPrecorso di Matematica\n\u201d which will be held before the TIT.\nIf failing the TOLC-I or the TIT, candidates will still be allowed to enroll, but will be assigned with the Additional Learning Requirements (\nObblighi Formativi Aggiuntivi \u2013 OFA\n) and\ncannot take any Degree Programme exam\nbefore their fulfilment.\nOFAs can be fulfilled passing a subsequent TOLC-I (in the scheduled venues and sessions \u2013\nCISIA Consortium\n) or passing one of the recovery tests (TIT) provided for by the\nRegulations on the Admission to the Degree Programmes of the School of Engineering\nof the University of Pisa.\nEnrolled students with OFAs must satisfy them in order to take second-year exams in the A.Y. 2023-2024. OFAs can be satisfied taking part in the TOLC-I provided by CISIA, also in TOLC@CASA mode, and obtaining a minimum score of 8/20 in the mathematics section, or passing an exam in the Scientific Disciplinary Areas of Mathematics or Physics, of the Degree Programmes included in the School of Engineering. In the event of exams taken in other Degree Programmes, the OFAs\u2019 satisfaction will be assessed by the relevant Degree Programme council.\nPlease find more details about study programmes and career opportunities at\nDegree Program web page\n.\n\u00a9 2024\nMatricolandosi\nContacts\nContacts for Holders of qualifications awarded abroad\nWis!

The possibility of modifying the doctor\u2019s choice will also be given in a simple way and with an exclusively telematic procedure.\nAll students who are entitled to join the initiative will receive a notice via the Educational Agenda portal (portale Agenda Didattica), which will allow them to register or renew their membership in the service in a very simple way.\nPosted in\nUncategorized\n\u00a9 2024\nMatricolandosi\nContacts\nContacts for Holders of qualifications awarded abroad\nWis!
