The schedule of incoming and outgoing flights is available on the Pisa\nairoport\u2019s website\n.\nThe airport is located on the outskirts of the city, about 3km from the city center. The easiest way to reach the center is probably by taxi. If no taxis are available, you can use the radio taxi service at the phone number (+39)050541600. Alternatively, you can take bus number 3 and get off at Piazza della Stazione, then take bus number 2 and get off at the stop on Via F. Buonarroti.\nYou can consult the\nmap of Pisa and the airport\n.\nBy Train\nPisa\u2019s train station is situated on the line connecting Turin to Rome. There are frequent connections to Florence. The train schedule is available on the\nTrenitalia website\n.\nThe department can be reached using bus number 2, getting off at the Via F. Buonarroti stop. The department is also reachable on foot from the station (20-30 minutes).\nYou can consult the map of the\ncity center\n.\nBy Car\nPisa is close to the intersection of two highways: the A12 highway that runs from north to south (Sestri Levante \u2013 Livorno) and the A11 highway that runs from east to west (Pisa \u2013 Florence). It is recommended to take the \u201cPisa Centro\u201d exit and continue along the Fi-Pi-Li major communication road until the \u201cPisa nord-est\u201d exit, following the directions on the\nmap from the south and east\n.\nIf you\u2019re coming from the North, it might be preferable to take the \u201cPisa Nord\u201d exit, continue on the Aurelia state road until you reach Pisa, and then follow the directions on the\nmap from the north\n.\nNote: Pisa is a small city with many pedestrian areas and limited traffic zones. Parking is a problem, and almost all parking spaces are paid.\nServices\nYou can consult\nPisa for you\n(hospitality, dining, mobility, services, accessibility).\n\u00a9 2024\nDepartment of Mathematics\nBack to top"}

{"doc_id": "NC9LcFRUfM", "title": "Project Description - Department of Mathematics", "description": "", "url": "https://www.dm.unipi.it/en/department-of-excellence/project-description/", "lang": "en", "text": "Project Description - Department of Mathematics\nSkip to content\nLogin\nSearch\nSearch\nIT\nDepartment\nHow to reach us\nOrganisation\nRoles and Collegial Bodies\nAdministrative Offices\nPeople\nMap\nDepartment of Excellence\nProject Description\nCoordination\nFunded Activities\nOpenings\nEvents\nNews\nEducation\nPh.D.\nResearch\nInternational\nHome\nDepartment of Excellence\nProject Description\nProject Description\nObjectives\nWe hereby illustrate the objectives of the project, divided into two main strategic aims: \u201cAdvanced education\u201d and \u201cMathematics of complex systems\u201d.\nAdvanced education\nAmong the most successful objectives pursued with conviction by the Department there are the training of Master\u2019s and Ph.D. students to an excellent level of scientific knowledge and the integration of young researchers in a context favourable for their full scientific growth. An advanced course offer with a broad educational range and an intense seminar programme are essential in order to implement tangible strategies in support of advanced education, as well as the participation of students and young researchers interested in starting or developing further a career oriented towards mathematical research.\r\nIn this respect we have set the following objectives:\nAppeal and internationalis\nation of the Ph.D. Programme\nWe deem important to further enhance the internationalisation of our Ph.D. Programme, both by trying to draw in students coming from abroad and by increasing the student exchange with Ph.D.\u2019s of other universities. The development potential in this direction can be observed from the numerous existing agreements for the exhcange of Master\u2019s students with universities abroad (ETH, EPFL, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, University of Bonn, Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, Ecole Polytechnique, French Scuola Normale\u2019s, Hokkaido University double degree programme).\nIncrease in the number of young researchers\nWe aim to significantly increase the total number of young researchers, Ph.D. students and research associates, which is still low in some research areas and does not always reach the minimum critical mass necessary to foster scientific vibrancy.\nStrengthening of the advanced course offer\nThe remarkable educational effort of the Deparment has meant that in recent years Ph.D. courses and some Master\u2019s Degree courses were held by professors in addition to their ordinary educational responsability. Courses maintained an excellent level of delivery and were sufficiently numerous, however the planning of the offer was at times a source of problems due to the difficulty in locating the necessary resources. We consider this a critical issue that needs to be addressed with energy via the recruitment of new professors and a robust programme of visiting in order to grow and consolidate the advanced course offer.\nThe achievement of these objectives, together with the high level of research activities of the Department and the proximity to the Scuola Normale, can make Pisa a reference point for doctoral and post-doctoral studies both nationally and internationally.\nMathematics of Complex Systems\nAn important challenge of modern science, which also explains various strategic directions taken by NRRP (National Recovery and Resilience Plan), is the understanding and the forecasting of the behaviour of complex systems, such as those emerging in the climate change, epidemic, life science, economic and social, machine learning and artificial intelligence models. These systems are characterised by a high level of dimensionality and from the variability of the constituent parameters. The understanding and the forecasting of the macro emerging behaviours and of their sensitivity with respect to the parameters defining a system are crucial to the study of a complex system. This aspect poses significant challenges both in the theoretical study and the development of suitable numerical methods.\r\nSome groups of the Department are already active on these topics, in particular with regards to mathematical models for applied sciences and data analysis. The research group in celestial mechanics has a long experience in the field of solar system dynamics and orbit and space mission calculations, and on these subjects it has already won two European Marie-Curie projects, and several projects with ASI (Italian Space Agency) and ESA. The group of mathematical physics has been enriched by the recent hire of an expert in problems in materials science and biological models (Muratov). The Analysis group has among its members experts in the study of statistical properties of dynamics, partial differential equations, calculus of variations, free boundary problems and shape optimisation.\r\nThe big advancements in data analysis and artificial intelligence observed in recent years require advanced mathematical tools for the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms regulating these phenomena. This research field is relatively new, even though some members of the Department can already offer meaningful contributions. Specifically, the expertise in the study of multi-component agent-based systems, rough path theory and the probabilistic approach to optimal transport has achieved recent results in reinforcement learning (Agazzi, Romito), the asymptotic study of neural networks and manifold learning (Trevisan). The expertise in algebraic topology is very promising for applications in topological data analysis, especially considering the support that can be given computationally by the group of numerical analysis, thanks to their vast experience in numerical methods for higher-dimensional systems and complex networks. Furthermore, thanks to the recent creation of the advanced course in \u201cData Analysis\u201d focused on the mathematics for machine learning, the Department is training students in the fields of statistics and of the theory of machine learning, which are highly sought-after by firms specializing in data analysis.\r\nWe deem strategic for our Department to strengthen and expand the research activity and the educational effort in the mathematics for complex systems, setting the following objectives:\nDevelopment of the research activity\nThe main objective is the development of the scientific activity related to the study of complex systems in order to make the Deparment a reference point in these research areas. The growth in modelling and computational expertise will play a key role towards reinforcing and extending the collaboration efforts with other research centres and the industrial sector. This objective will be achieved via the recruitment of new researchers and the strengthening of the knowledge base already available to the Deparment, through the invitation of experts and the organisation of classes, workshops and conferences.\nStudents and young researchers training\nAnother objective, closely related to the previous one, is the training of students and young researchers, via the increase in the educational offer on these topics. We anticipate this will raise the appeal of our Degrees and Ph.D. Programme, with a resulting increase in the number of students coming from other universities.\nPlan of action\nThis is the list of the main action points that will be carried out to reach the set objectives:\nStaff recruitment\nA key point for the success of the project is the recruitment of new staff. During the project lifespan we aim to hire a good number of external researchers, young and with a high-profile scientifically, and to offer them \u201ctenure track\u201d and permanent positions. Staff hired with this process will be integrated both toward working on research lines already being developed by the groups of the department, and toward contributing to the progress of the research lines described above.\r\nIt is important to highlight the possibility to have the central offices of the University co-finance the recruitment of the teaching staff with 3 positions for \u201ctenure track\u201d researchers.\nAppeal and internationalisation of the Ph.D. Programme\nWe aim to enhance the offer of the Ph.D. Programme to improve its competitiveness internationally. The actions we deem of paramount importance to this end are the increase in the duration of the scholarships from 3 to 4 years, the supply of additional scholarships (indicatively 2 per year), and the increase in the funding provided by each scholarship. In addition, we aim to increase the funds available to the mobility of Ph.D. students.\nPost-doctoral grants\nThe offer of post-doctoral positions is rather limited and we consider a priority its upgrade to international standards. This initiative is fundamental to the objective of an increased internationalisation of the Department. The actions regarding the Ph.D. Programme and the post-doctoral grants require also an upgrade to the current structures that at present are considered undersized.\nAdvanced course offer\nThe increase in the educational offer of the Master\u2019s Degree and the Ph.D. Programme will be achieved first of all with the recruitment of new staff, who will be able to contribute directly to the supply of advanced courses and also to free up resources currently employed in different study courses. Moreover, we aim to finance an intense programme of visiting fellows, to teach courses and to interact with the students, researchers and professors of the Department.\nClasses and workshops\nAnnual classes will be organised targeted towards Ph.D students and young researchers; furthermore, the organisation of international conferences will be promoted and, at least biennially, one will be organised on topics related to the mathematics of complex systems.\nWorking group for the collaboration with businesses and other institutions\nCreation of a working group to promote the collaboration between the Department and external companies, tasked with handling the communication with the firms and with drafting the cooperation agreements on the topics of research and development.\nRelationships with schools\nDevelopment of the connections and collaborations with schools by means of training activities for teachers and orientation events (stages, laboratories) on the project topics aimed at high school students.\nPhysical infrastructure\nThe creation of new spaces and the rationalisation and renovation of existing ones are fundamental to the purpose of the project. To this end, we expect the integration of new bodies on the roofing of the building totaling a surface area of approximately 200sq m, to be realized according to the principles of sustainable and  bioclimatic architecture. Existing spaces will be reorganised and the furniture will be renovated in order to make them more functional.\nDigital infrastructure\nResearch on complex systems requires computing resources that can allow the manipulation of a numerically large amount of data. In particular, we expect the purchase of \r\na GPU server to increase the computing power at disposal of the Department, and the purchase of a server for the maintenance of the computing resources of all students and teaching staff.\n\u00a9 2024\nDepartment of Mathematics\nBack to top"}

Each programme consists of some core fundamental courses, which provide a systematic and in-depth description of the main ideas underlying the major branches of mathematics (algebra, geometry, education, mathematical analysis, probability, mathematical physics, numerical analysis \u2013\u00a0 the chosen programme dictates the selection from these topics). Nevertheless, as part of each programme students can also select from several thematic courses based on more recent and advanced topics (even in the areas of logic, history of mathematics and operational research, which are not covered in the fundamental courses). These courses are often held by professors from the Department of Mathematics (or from the Department of Computer Science in the case of operational research), who are involved in leading international research studies in their field of specialization. Moreover, thanks to the lasting and stable relationships held with the\nScuola Normale Superiore\n, our students can also include some courses offered by the\nScuola Normale\nin their study plans.\nAfter obtaining the Master\u2019s Degree in Mathematics, students may continue their studies with a\nPh.D. programme\n, of which the University of Pisa offers an ample selection, or may enter the\nworld of work,\nwhere their in-depth competencies are highly valued.\nSome notes about the course of study:\nthe degree course is demanding, but it rewards with in-depth skills that are highly valued in the job market and form the ideal basis to continue to a PhD programme;\nstudents can choose from five different programmes: Applied, Educational, General, Modelling and Theoretical;\nstudents can select various courses from specific groups to be inserted in their study plan, which as a result can be highly flexible. Students may also include two free-choice courses, chosen from the ones active at other departments or from Ph.D. courses at the University of Pisa (e.g.\nthis is the list\nof Ph.D. courses in Mathematics offered by our Department in 2024-25) or from Master or Ph.D. courses at Scuola Normale Superiore.\nthe University has in place many active\ninternational agreements\n, including Erasmus and double degrees, so it is possible to spend a period of study abroad, or even to obtain two degrees (more info can be found on the\ninternational\u00a0page\n).\nWe suggest to see\nhere\n(link to page in Italian) the articles on \u201cJobs for mathematicians\u201d, \u201cMathematicians at work\u201d and \u201cEmployment statistics\u201d in the \u201cOutgoing\u201d section for further inspiration, motivation or information on the employment prospects.\nAll the information about enrolment procedures, including\npossible scholarships\n(link in Italian), is available in the menu at the top of the page.

Details on these topics can be found below.\nThe group runs a Seminar Series: further information can be found at this\nlink\n.\nResearch Topics\nModel theory\nWe study the model theory of\nordered fields\nendowed with an\nexponential\nfunction and/or a\nderivation\nand/or a\nvaluation\n. Typical examples are the real exponential field $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathsf{exp}}$, the differential field $\\mathbb T$ of\ntransseries\n, Conway\u2019s field $\\mathbf{No}$ of\nsurreal numbers\n, Hahn\u2019s fields of generalized series. These subjects are strictly related. $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathsf{exp}}$ is elementarily equivalent to $(\\mathbf{No},\\mathsf{exp})$ where $\\mathsf{exp}\\colon \\mathbf{No} \\to \\mathbf{No}$ is the exponential map of Kruskal and Gonshor. Moreover $\\mathbb T$ is is elementarily equivalent to $(\\mathbf{No},\\partial)$ where $\\partial\\colon \\mathbf{No} \\to \\mathbf{No}$ is the derivation introduced by Berarducci and Mantova. Berarducci-Mamino showed that $\\mathbf{No}$ can find applications to the\nasymptotic analysis\nof iterated exponential polynomials (Skolem functions).\nA long-term project is to study Tarski\u2019s question of whether the theory of $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathsf{exp}}$ is\ndecidable\n. Macintyre-Wilkie (1996) proved the decidability assuming Schanuel\u2019s conjecture (SC) in transcendental number theory.\nBuilding on this and the work of various collaborators, we intend to address the problem of whether, assuming SC, any o-minimal EXP-field is elementary equivalent to $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathsf{exp}}$. We expect that the study of the residue structure (with respect to the natural valuation) can provide important information.\nWe also concentrate on another line of research in the model theory of ordered structures, namely the study of ordered abelian groups equipped with an\nautomorphism\n, with a special focus on the\nexistentially closed\nones.\nThe latter form a class which is not elementary, but to which model-theoretic techniques may nevertheless be applied, by using\npositive logic\nin the sense of Ben Yaacov and Poizat (2007). Current work in progress deals with the amalgamation of ordered abelian groups with an automorphism, and with generalized stability-theoretic properties of their class.\nDefinable groups in o-minimal structures, which present striking analogies with real Lie groups, can be studied by using generalisations of techniques which originally arose in stability theory, such as\ngeneric types\nand\nconnected components\n. In the o-minimal context and beyond, other stability-theoretic notions which can be used on suitable spaces of types, e.g. global\ninvariant\nones, include the\nMorley product\n,\northogonality\n, and\ndomination\n. We investigate the compatibility of domination with the Morley product and, when compatibility holds, the structure of the resulting quotient semigroup, the\ndomination monoid\n, in various classes of theories, such as the o-minimal ones, theories of henselian valued fields, and more.\nMembers\nAlessandro Berarducci\nalessandro.berarducci@unipi.it\nMarcello Mamino\nmarcello.mamino@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nAnnalisa Conversano (Massey University)\nJan Dobrowolski (University of Manchester)\nMartin Hils (Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster)\nhils@uni-muenster.de\nSalma Kuhlmann (Universit\u00e4t Konstanz)\nVincenzo Mantova (University of Leeds)\nMicka\u00ebl Matusinski (Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux)\nRosario Mennuni (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano (La Statale))\nrosario.mennuni@dm.unipi.it\nNon-standard methods in Ramsey theory and combinatorics\nIn recent years, a new line of research has emerged in which the problems of Ramsey Theory and additive combinatorics are studied using the perspective and methods of nonstandard analysis. In particular, we focus our research in two directions. The first direction is Arithmetic Ramsey Theory, where one looks for monochromatic configurations which are found in every finite coloring of the integers. Two main open problems in this context are the existence of monochromatic Pythagorean triples $a,b,c$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, and of monochromatic additive-multiplicative quadruples $a, b, a + b, a \\cdot b$. The second direction is the area of additive combinatorics where one looks for arithmetic configurations which are found in every set of integers of positive asymptotic density.\nMembers\nMauro Di Nasso\nmauro.di.nasso@unipi.it\nMariaclara Ragosta\nmariaclara.ragosta@phd.unipi.it\nCollaborators\nIsaac Goldbring (Irvine University)\nRenling Jin (College of Charleston)\njinr@charleston.edu\nLorenzo Luperi Baglini (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano (La Statale))\nMoreno Pierobon (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nmoreno.pierobon@phd.unipi.it\nSet theory and foundations\nOur foundational research is devoted to the consistency of a theory of numerosity in the general context of a set-theoretic universe. Numerosity Theory aims to generalize cardinality in order to maintain the property that proper subsets have smaller numerosity. Starting from the construction of models for the theory of numerosity, several problems have naturally emerged about the existence of ultrafilters with special properties. Also in Arithmetic Ramsey Theory, ultrafilters with peculiar properties are often used, such as idempotent and minimal ultrafilters. Our research in Set Theory and Foundations focuses on the construction of models for the numerosity theory, and on the study of the aforementioned special classes of ultrafilters.\nMembers\nMauro Di Nasso\nmauro.di.nasso@unipi.it\nMarco Forti\nforti@dma.unipi.it\nCollaborators\nAndreas R.

Originally motivated by foundational and philosophical questions, its methods have now evolved into very fine tools which have found profound applications in many branches of mathematics. Among the main subfields of mathematical logic, the project focuses on axiomatic set theory, computability theory, descriptive set theory and model theory. Motivated by both internal and external questions, all these fields have developed over the years into advanced technologies which interact with each other and which have found striking applications in mainstream mathematics. Our long-established research network specializes in these four sectors of mathematical logic, with emphasis on classification questions and concrete applications to mathematics.\n\nThe scientific goals of our project have a broad range. We plan to achieve progress towards:\n- the question of decidability of the real exponential field;\n- Zilber\u2019s conjecture on the complex exponential field;\n- connections between surreal numbers and transseries;\n- generalizations of Herzog\u2019s work on universal enveloping algebras;\n- model theory of Steiner systems and connections with relevant combinatorics;\n- classification problems in group theory from the perspective of descriptive set theory;\n- model theory of groups and of ordered abelian groups;\n- automorphism groups of ultrametric Polish spaces;\n- generalized descriptive set theory for singular cardinals;\n- connections between reverse mathematics and Weihrauch reducibility.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

The connections between these two areas have historically been fundamental for many of their developments; arguably, the most famous exemplification of this fact is Ramsey Theorem.\n\nWe plan to investigate five different research lines.\nThe first line concerns the so-called arithmetic Ramsey Theory, namely the partition regularity of combinatorial configurations on the integers, a topic that has attracted the interest of the mathematical community in the past few years. We will focus on specific problems regarding polynomial and exponential configurations, on the natural numbers as well as on abstract structures.\n\nThe second line regards the logico-computational strength of Hindman Theorem (HT). This theorem features a deep interplay of logical, computational and combinatorial methods. In particular, we plan to study the strength (in the sense of reverse and computable mathematics) of some restrictions and of some finite versions of HT, and the role of the apartness condition.\n\nThe third line concerns densities and Keisler measures. These are finitely additive measures on algebras of definable sets. Loeb samples will be our main tool. Firstly we will compare properties of Loeb samples to known properties of Keisler measures and then study applications to combinatorics, including extensions of the famous B+C property of sets of positive density.\n\nThe fourth line concerns quasi-orders and applications; this is an area full of open problems with ramifications to a wide range of areas, including reverse mathematics, Ramsey theory, model checking. We plan to study graph minors, \u03b1-better quasi orders and better quasi order preservation properties.\n\nThe fifth line is centered on studying the computational limits to finite provability, analysing the complexity of proving combinatorial statements in different logical proof systems. Proof complexity is our guiding line. This is a core research area at the border between logic, combinatorics and complexity mainly aimed at solving whether NP is equal P. Its main question is proving that every proof system fails on proving efficiently at least a family of theorems and is grounded on techniques drawn from logic, combinatorics and complexity theory.

Our research focuses on arithmetically relevant actions of Galois groups on algebro-geometric objects (such as number rings and their class groups, or abelian varieties and their Selmer groups). Via Iwasawa theory, algebraic invariants of such actions can sometimes be related to analytic objects (L-functions).\nMembers\nAndrea Bandini\nandrea.bandini@unipi.it\nIlaria Del Corso\nilaria.delcorso@unipi.it\nLorenzo Furio\nlorenzo.furio@phd.unipi.it\nDavide Lombardo\ndavide.lombardo@unipi.it\nBelow is the list of the specific topics studied in this research area, each of them with a detailed description and the lists of members and collaborators.\nArithmetic of abelian varieties\nElliptic curves and higher-dimensional abelian varieties are fundamental objects of study in number theory. Our investigations focus mainly on their Galois representations, especially over number fields, in the spirit of the Mumford-Tate and Sato-Tate conjectures. We consider in particular the possible existence of nontrivial endomorphisms on a given abelian variety (with special attention given to the case of Jacobians), with implications for the arithmetic of low-genus curves. We also work on related problems, including Kummer theory (the study of division points of non-torsion points on commutative algebraic groups) and the determination of rational points on curves.\nMembers\nLorenzo Furio\nlorenzo.furio@phd.unipi.it\nDavide Lombardo\ndavide.lombardo@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nVictoria Cantoral Farf\u00e1n (Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen)\nvictoria.cantoralfarfan@mathematik.uni-goettingen.de\nAndrea Gallese (SNS, Pisa)\nSamuel Le Fourn (Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes)\nSamuel.Le-Fourn@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr\nMatteo Verzobio (IST Austria)\nmatteo.verzobio@gmail.com\nJohn Voight (Dartmouth College)\nDavid Zywina (Cornell University)\n(Hopf) Galois module theory and skew braces\nHopf-Galois module theory is a generalisation of Galois module theory, where the action of a Galois group is replaced by that of a $K$-Hopf algebra. This generalisation is fruitful both for enlarging the set of extensions under consideration and for better describing wild extensions. We work on questions in both these settings.\nThe Hopf-Galois structures on a $G$-Galois field extension are in one-to-one correspondence with suitable subgroups of the permutation group on $G$, and are closely connected with skew braces. The focus of our research is both on the classification of Hopf-Galois structures and on the study of the properties of the skew braces as well as their equivalent from the Hopf-Galois point of view.\nWe are also employing the language and the properties of the braces in the study of some problems of commutative algebra.\nMembers\nIlaria Del Corso\nilaria.delcorso@unipi.it\nDavide Lombardo\ndavide.lombardo@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nElena Campedel (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca)\nAndrea Caranti (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trento)\nFabio Ferri (University of Exeter)\nLorenzo Stefanello (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nlorenzo.stefanello@phd.unipi.it\nSenne Trappeniers (Vrije Universiteit Brussel)\nPaul Truman (Keele University)\np.j.truman@keele.ac.uk\nIwasawa theory and Drinfeld modular forms\nIwasawa theory studies modules (like class groups and Selmer groups) associated to global fields and abelian varieties in all characteristics, in an attempt to link algebraic invariants (like orders of class groups and ranks of elliptic curves) to analytic ones (i.e. special values of $L$-functions).\nThe study of Drinfeld modular forms is currently focused on their structure in an attempt to define old forms and new forms, and on their slopes with respect to the action of the Hecke algebra. The main goal is\u00a0to establish an analog of Hida theory for function fields.\nMembers\nAndrea Bandini\nandrea.bandini@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nFrancesc Bars (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona)\nIgnazio Longhi (Universit\u00e0 di Torino)\nignazio.longhi@unito.it\nMaria Valentino (Universit\u00e0 della Calabria)\nStefano Vigni (Universit\u00e0 di Genova)\nLie theory\nMembers\nGiovanni Gaiffi\ngiovanni.gaiffi@unipi.it\nDavide Lombardo\ndavide.lombardo@unipi.it\nAndrea Maffei\nandrea.maffei@unipi.it\nLeonardo Patimo\nleonardo.patimo@unipi.it\nFrancesco Sala\nfrancesco.sala@unipi.it\nBelow is the list of the specific topics studied in this research area, each of them with a detailed description and the lists of members and collaborators.\nContinuum Lie algebras and quantum groups\nThe theories of continuum quantum groups and continuum Kac-Moody algebras associated with one-dimensional manifolds (\u2018real curves\u2019) can be thought of as continuum colimits of quantized enveloping algebras and Kac-Moody Lie algebras, respectively. These algebraic structures have rather peculiar properties, e.g. they are governed by a continuum root system with infinitely many elements and no simple roots.\nAt the moment, we are investigating \u2018continuum\u2019 analogs of representations, integrable systems, and affinizations of quantum groups.\nMembers\nFrancesco Sala\nfrancesco.sala@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nAndrea Appel (Universit\u00e0 di Parma)\nOlivier Schiffmann (CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Saclay)\nolivier.schiffmann@universite-paris-saclay.fr\nOpers on the punctured disc\nFrenkel and Gaitsgory proposed a version of the Langlands correspondence in the case of the field $\\mathbb{C}((t))$. Given a quasi-simple group $G$ such a proposal relates the geometry of the space of $G$ connections on the disk with a singularity in the origin and representations of the Langlands dual group of $G$. The tool that allows one to build a bridge between these objects is the Feigin-Frenkel theorem which describes the center of the enveloping algebra of an affine Lie algebra at the critical level as the functions on a space of connections for the dual algebra, called the space of Opers, introduced by Beilinson and Drinfeld. In this theory, vertex algebras play a key role in both the proof of the Feigin-Frenkel theorem and the development of the theory of Frenkel and Gaitsgory.\nThe local geometric correspondence is largely conjectural, but in the case of \u201cspherical\u201d representations, which corresponds to the case of monodromy-free connections, Frenkel and Gaitsgory gave complete proof.\nWe are studying a version of this correspondence in the case of families of connections on the disk with two singular points $0$ and $a$. In this case, we consider an analogue of the affine algebra, which we denote by $\\mathfrak{g}(2)$, on the ring $\\mathbb{C}[[a]]$. In the case $\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ we were able to construct a family of elements that generalize Sugawara operators and generate the center of the enveloping algebra of $\\mathfrak{g}(2)$ at the critical level. We have also provided a description of endomorphisms of a Weyl module similar to the one given by Frenkel and Gaitsgory in the usual case. We intend to continue the study started with this work by extending the results in various directions.\nMembers\nDavide Lombardo\ndavide.lombardo@unipi.it\nAndrea Maffei\nandrea.maffei@unipi.it\nCollaborators and Ph.D. students at other institutions\nLuca Casarin (Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma)\nAlberto De Sole (Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma)\nGiorgia Fortuna (Reply)\nValerio Melani (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze)\nSymmetric and spherical varieties\nIf $G$ is a reductive group and $H$ is the subgroup of points fixed under an involution then $G/H$ is called a\nsymmetric variety\n. They have been extensively studied in relation to problems coming from representation theory or algebraic geometry and in particular enumerative geometry. Symmetric varieties are a particular case of spherical varieties: normal $G$ variety with a finite number of $B$ orbits. The classification of spherical varieties has been obtained recently. We study different aspects of symmetric and spherical varieties: compactifications, description of the coordinate ring, applications to the study of normality of particular classes of $G$ variety important in representation theory.\nAn important theme is a study of the classification of $B$ orbits in these varieties and their Bruhat order.\nMembers\nAndrea Maffei\nandrea.maffei@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nRocco Chiriv\u00ec (Universit\u00e0 del Salento)\nJacopo Gandini (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna)\nPierluigi Moseneder (Politecnico di Milano)\nPaolo Papi (Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma)\nPeople\nFaculty\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nAndrea\nBandini\nandrea.bandini@unipi.it\nMassimo\nCaboara\nmassimo.caboara@unipi.it\nMichele\nD'Adderio\nmichele.dadderio@unipi.it\nIlaria\nDel Corso\nilaria.delcorso@unipi.it\nGiovanni\nGaiffi\ngiovanni.gaiffi@unipi.it\nAlessandro\nIraci\nalessandro.iraci@unipi.it\nDavide\nLombardo\ndavide.lombardo@unipi.it\nAndrea\nMaffei\nandrea.maffei@unipi.it\nLeonardo\nPatimo\nleonardo.patimo@unipi.it\nEnrico\nSbarra\nenrico.sbarra@unipi.it\nAffiliate Members\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nRoberto\nDvornicich\nroberto.dvornicich@gmail.com\nFormer Members\nthere is no data\nPostdoctoral Fellows\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nMatthew\nBisatt\nVassilis Dionyssis\nMoustakas\nvasileios.moustakas@dm.unipi.it\nPh.D. Students at the University of Pisa\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nLorenzo\nFurio\nlorenzo.furio@phd.unipi.it\nPh.D. Students at other institutions\nName\nSurname\nAffiliation\nLuca\nCasarin\nSapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma\nAndrea\nGallese\nSNS, Pisa\nGiovanni\nInterdonato\nSNS, Pisa\nRoberto\nRiccardi\nSNS, Pisa\nPh.D. Theses supervised by members of the group\nawarded by the University of Pisa\nYear\nName\nSurname\nTitle of the Thesis\nSupervisor(s)\n2024\nLorenzo\nStefanello\nHopf-Galois structures, skew braces, and their connection\nIlaria  Del Corso\nand Paul  Truman\n2022\nMichele\nCarmassi\nThe B-orbits on a Hermitian symmetric variety: the characteristic 2 case and the Bruhat G-order\nAndrea  Maffei\n2021\nMatteo\nVerzobio\nPrimitive divisors of elliptic divisibility sequences\nRoberto  Dvornicich\n2020\nAlessio\nMoscariello\nLacunary polynomials and compositions\nRoberto  Dvornicich\nand Umberto  Zannier\n2019\nAlessandro\nIraci\nMacdonald polynomials and the Delta conjecture\nMichele  D'Adderio\nand\nGiovanni  Gaiffi\n2018\nOscar\nPapini\nComputational Aspects of Line and Toric Arrangements\nGiovanni  Gaiffi\nand\nMario  Salvetti\n2016\nMaria Rosaria\nPati\nExtensions of p-power degree of a p-adic field\nRoberto  Dvornicich\n2016\nFrancesco\nStrazzanti\nA family of quotients of the Rees algebra and rigidity properties of local cohomology modules\nEnrico  Sbarra\n2009\nLuca\nCaputo\nOn the structure of \u00e9tale wild kernels of number fields\nRoberto  Dvornicich\nand Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Jaulent\n2009\nMarco\nStrambi\nEffective estimates for coverings of curves over number fields\nYuri F.

The project centres around the arithmetic of (semi)abelian varieties, both for its intrinsic importance and as a tool to study the absolute Galois groups of fields. Related themes are also explored, such as rational and integral points on modular curves and on more general varieties, modular forms (also over function fields), and pure algebraic number theory, with an emphasis on the recently developed theory of Hopf-Galois extensions. The main motivating problems are questions of Serre, Mumford and Tate concerning the Galois representations attached to abelian varieties and conjectures in the field of \u2018Unlikely Intersections\u2019 associated with the names of Bombieri, Masser, Zannier, Zilber and Pink. Furthermore, the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (and its analogues for function fields) and conjectures by Lang-Vojta and Campana all help inform the research directions of the members of the group.\nThe scientific goals of the project can be roughly summarised as follows.\nWe will classify Galois representations attached to abelian varieties over number fields and deduce consequences for arithmetic questions (isogenies, cases of the Sato-Tate conjecture, number of rational points of curves over finite fields, problems related to the Lang-Trotter conjecture). \nConcerning Unlikely Intersections, in addition to proving new cases of the Zilber-Pink conjecture, we are going to investigate problems of effectivity, the invariance of the conjectures under field extensions, and applications. We aim to establish further instances of the Lang-Vojta and Campana conjectures, both over number fields and function fields, and of their hyperbolic analogues, and consider applications to various number-theoretic problems.\nIn Hopf-Galois theory, we shall investigate how the properties of a field extension relate to its different Hopf-Galois structures (for field extensions within classes where this is not yet well understood)\u201a and in particular, clarify the link between such structures and the ramification properties of the extension.  \nConcerning Drinfeld modular forms, we will investigate the structure of old-, new- and cusp forms and understand the relations between eigenvalues and Fourier coefficients. We will also try to construct v-adic families of modular forms \u00e0 la Hida-Coleman.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

The extremely diverse nature of problems, techniques and perspectives it involves is reflected in the project, which comprises mathematicians of different background and specialisation.\nFor the sake of convenience, we will split the description of the project in three main sections.\n\n> VERTEX ALGEBRAS AND W-ALGEBRAS. We investigate the structure, representations and applications of some algebraic objects whose definition originates in theoretical physics. Many of these structures are connected with the notion of vertex algebra, with special focus on a family of interesting examples: W-algebras.\n\n> HYPERPLANE ARRANGEMENTS AND COXETER GROUPS. Here, we deal with the combinatorial investigation of hyperplane and toric arrangements and the description of the so-called Kazhdan-Lusztig cells. Particularly relevant in this section is the K($\\pi$,1) conjecture.\n\n> GEOMETRIC METHODS IN REPRESENTATION THEORY. We study some geometric structures that are of interest in representation theory. We will present some classical problems that deal with nilpotent orbits, standard monomial theory and homogeneous varieties, and a geometric approach towards Nichols algebras. \nBefore the very description of the project, we would like to stress that the above splitting is only a rhetorical expedient, rather than a concrete breakdown of what is instead a unitary research plan. \n\nCombinatorics of root systems and Coxeter groups is a universal tool in the research we are about to outline and serves as a lingua franca for the entire project. Reduction of topological, geometric or representation theoretical problems to combinatorial structures constitutes one of the paradigms of Lie theory. Thes facts transpires directly also from our research interests: in the study of hyperplane arrangements, in the classification problems, in the investigation of coordinate rings. The use of symmetries in the study and construction of geometric structures sits at the core of the outmost developments in Lie Theory. On the other hand, reformulating Lie theoretical problems in a geometric language is a common technique toward their solution. Many results in W-algebra theory, for instance, directly translate into corresponding claims in the geometry of nilpotent orbits.\nAs a result, problems that are native to a certain area may find their solution in a different one, and even shed light on apparently distant questions. Many of the members of the present projects enjoy long-standing collaborations and there is a constant exchange of researchers and students among the research nodes. We are therefore convinced that the interaction between Lie theorists with diverse formations and backgrounds is of paramount importance for achieving a team\u2019s research interests.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

We give three prominent examples:\n\n\u2022 the Rota-Heron-Welsh conjecture (1970) of log-concavity of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of matroids, fully solved in (2018);\n\n\u2022 the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture (1979) of positivity of the polynomials named after them, fully solved in (2014);\n\n\u2022 the Macdonald conjecture (1988) of positivity of the q,t-Kostka coefficients, first proved in (2001).\n\nEach of these breakthroughs has been both the culmination of an intense research activity, and the catalyst of exciting new developments in algebraic and topological combinatorics. The aim of this project is to pursue new results in these three lines of research, promoting a fruitful cooperation among our research units and the international community. Hence, the project is divided into three parts.\n\nThe first part regards the combinatorics and topology arising from hyperplane arrangements and subspace arrangements, like matroids and polymatroids. We plan to study how far the methods in the pioneering work can be extended to the polymatroid case, following a line started. In particular, can we prove log-concavity statements for certain classes of polymatroids? Can we define Kazhdan-Lusztig (KL) polynomials of polymatroids, and give them both a combinatorial and geometric description?\n\nThe second part concerns the combinatorics and topology related to KL polynomials of Coxetergroups and Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan (KLV) polynomials, like special matchings and local intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties. The goals will be to make progress on the combinatorial invariance conjecture: can we prove combinatorially the new breakthrough formula? What about an analogous statement for the KLV polynomials, which are to symmetric varieties what the KL polynomials are to Schubert varieties? Can we relate KLV polynomials to singularities of symmetric quiver representation varieties?\n\nThe third part involves the combinatorics and topology related to the symmetric functions, like labelled Dyck paths (occurring in the famous shuffle conjecture and in the Delta conjectures), affine Springer fibers, and graph colorings. Can we make progress on the valley Delta conjecture and on a related conjecture on the Hilbert series of super diagonal coinvariants? Can we find a categorification for the Tutte symmetric function?\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

In recent years, new meanings of the word \u201ccounting\u201d have arisen, wherein instead of trying to calculate explicit numbers, one seeks to understand \u201chigher\u201d structures that underlie the geometry: various filtrations and algebra actions on (co)homology groups of the spaces involved, lifts of such structures to K-theory groups and derived categories, and from here to connections to categorified link invariants and diagrammatic categories. For example, a successful realization of such a program in recent years was the interpretation of Donaldson-Thomas invariants via cohomological / K-theoretic / categorified Hall algebras, which continues to produce beautiful mathematics.\n\nA recurring feature in studying such \u201chigher structures\u201d pertaining to algebraic spaces is the appearance of quantum groups and vertex algebras, that provide symmetries for the geometry in question, and they are ubiquitous in the study of cohomological/K-theoretic/categorified structures. \n\nThe purpose of this project is for the PI\u2019s from MIT and the University of Pisa to share their complementary knowledge in various applications of the theories of quantum groups and vertex algebras to the \u201chigher counting\u201d in enumerative geometry, with the goal of uncovering deeper connections between fields and discovering new geometric features of algebraic spaces.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

This recent theory has been fruitfully applied to questions regarding special kinds of degenerations of varieties or other more complicated objects, and compactifications of moduli spaces, for example in the context of mirror symmetry. There are also very interesting interactions with the field of tropical (and non-Archimedean) geometry.

Its \u201cgeography\u201d has been extensively studied. Furthermore, a modular compactification of it is the moduli\nspace of stable surfaces, i.e. semi-log-canonical surfaces with ample canonical divisor. The activity of the group is focused on the analysis of the compactified moduli space $\\mathcal{M}(a,b)$ (where $a=K^2$ and $b$ is the holomorphic Euler characteristic), with particular attention to the case of surfaces with low numerical invariants. Such analysis is given by studying log-canonical pairs via a classical approach and analyzing the singularities, via Deformation Theory, and a detailed study of the canonical ring.\nRelated goals are to extend the knowledge of the moduli space by analyzing $\\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein surfaces and to study the Hodge theoretic approach, by associating to a variety its cohomology and analyzing the induced variation of Hodge structures.\nMembers\nMarco Franciosi\nmarco.franciosi@unipi.it\nRita Pardini\nrita.pardini@unipi.it\nGregory James Pearlstein\ngreg.pearlstein@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nStephen Coughlan (Mary Immaculate College)\nstephen.coughlan@mic.ul.ie\nBarbara Fantechi (SISSA, Trieste)\nfantechi@sissa.it\nMatthias Leopold Nickel (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nmatthias.nickel@dm.unipi.it\nJulie F.

A particular focus is on coalescent models of evolution, in which gene trees, representing the evolutionary history of individual genes sampled from a set of species, evolve along the branches of species trees, reflecting the history of species divergences. In order to understand how features of the species tree can influence the distribution of the possible gene trees, the number and probability of the combinatorially different configurations that gene trees can assume within a given species tree are investigated. When individual gene copies are selected within a single species, the gene tree is modeled as a random coalescent tree that evolves independently of the branching pattern of the species tree, and the goal is to describe the distributive properties of its combinatorial parameters.\nMembers\nFilippo Disanto\nfilippo.disanto@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nMichael Fuchs (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU))\nNoah A.

Using techniques coming from both differential geometry and algebraic topology we studied the rich geometrical structure of analytic varieties that can be obtained as fixed point sets of a holomorphic self-map, proving a number of index theorems generalising to this setting classical Baum-Bott and Lehmann-Suwa theorems known for holomorphic foliations, and with applications to holomorphic dynamics.\nMembers\nMarco Abate\nmarco.abate@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nEinstein and special metrics\nWe study the aspect of differential geometry that revolves around the explicit construction of Einstein or special metrics, with special emphasis on the case where the metric is either homogeneous or of cohomogeneity one.\nRiemannian homogeneous Einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature can be identified with left-invariant metrics on a Lie group, and more precisely standard metrics on a solvable Lie algebra. In the pseudo-Riemannian case, homogeneous Einstein metric need not be standard, and the Lie algebra may be nilpotent. Our goal is to prove more general structure results for arbitrary signature, and obtain classifications under suitable extra assumptions.\nRegardless of any assumption of invariance, among Einstein metrics one finds those of special holonomy and those that admit a Killing spinor; weaker geometries can also be considered. All these fall into the class of special metrics. Of particular interest to us is the interplay between the intrinsic torsion and curvature of a special metric.

A typical example consists in using the behaviour of the natural invariant (under biholomorphisms) metrics and distances defined on complex manifolds to study the boundary behaviour of holomorphic functions or the action of integral operators on spaces of holomorphic functions. In particular, we are using the Kobayashi metric and distance in pseudoconvex and convex domains to study the boundary behaviour of the derivatives of a holomorphic function at a specific point in the boundary and, more recently, to study the mapping properties of Toeplitz operators on weighted Bergmann spaces using characterisations of Carleson measures expressed in terms of Kobayashi balls.\nMembers\nMarco Abate\nmarco.abate@unipi.it\nFabrizio Bianchi\nfabrizio.bianchi@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nMatteo Fiacchi (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nmatteo.fiacchi@dm.unipi.it\nJasmin Raissy (Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux)\nKarim Rakhimov (National University of Uzbekistan)\nHolomorphic dynamical systems\nIn the last forty years, the study of holomorphic dynamical systems has become one of the most important topics in complex analysis and complex geometry of one and several variables, at the forefront of contemporary mathematical research. In Pisa, we are particularly interested in studying:\nthe global dynamics of holomorphic self-maps of hyperbolic manifolds and domains, and more generally of non-expanding self-maps of Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces;\nthe local dynamics around a non-hyperbolic fixed point;\nthe dynamics of meromorphic connections on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces;\nthe global dynamics of complex dynamical systems in any dimension (endomorphisms of projective spaces, H\u00e9non maps, automorphisms of Kahler manifolds), usually through pluripotential theory methods;\nStability and bifurcation phenomena in one and several complex variables.\nMembers\nMarco Abate\nmarco.abate@unipi.it\nFabrizio Bianchi\nfabrizio.bianchi@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nMatteo Fiacchi (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nmatteo.fiacchi@dm.unipi.it\nJasmin Raissy (Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux)\nKarim Rakhimov (National University of Uzbekistan)\nGeometric topology\nMembers\nRiccardo Benedetti\nriccardobenedetti53@gmail.com\nFilippo Bianchi\nfilippo.bianchi@phd.unipi.it\nFilippo Gianluca Callegaro\nfilippo.callegaro@unipi.it\nCarlo Collari\ncarlo.collari@dm.unipi.it\nMichele D'Adderio\nmichele.dadderio@unipi.it\nRoberto Frigerio\nroberto.frigerio@unipi.it\nGiovanni Gaiffi\ngiovanni.gaiffi@unipi.it\nViola Giovannini\nv.giovannini1@studenti.unipi.it\nPaolo Lisca\npaolo.lisca@unipi.it\nBruno Martelli\nbruno.martelli@unipi.it\nCarlo Petronio\ncarlo.petronio@unipi.it\nMario Salvetti\nmario.salvetti@unipi.it\nAndrea Tamburelli\nandrea.tamburelli@unipi.it\nBelow is the list of the specific topics studied in this research area, each of them with a detailed description and the lists of members and collaborators.\nClassical and higher rank Teichm\u00fcller theory\nThis area of research studies the geometric and dynamical properties of representations of the fundamental group of a surface $S$ (of negative Euler characteristic) into a Lie group $G$. For example, when $G=\\mathbb{P}\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$, conjugacy classes of discrete and faithful representations are\u00a0in bijection with the Teichm\u00fcller space of\u00a0$S$, the space of marked hyperbolic (or complex) structures on $S$. More in general, and especially for Lie groups of rank $2$ (i.e., $G=\\mathrm{SL}(3,\\mathbb{R}), \\mathrm{Sp}(4, \\mathbb{R}, \\mathrm{SO}(2,2), G_{2}$), researchers have identified special connected components of the character variety $\\mathrm{Hom}(\\pi_{1}(S), G)/G$ that parametrize geometric structures on $S$, or fiber bundles over $S$, and share a lot of similarities with the classical Teichm\u00fcller space.\nThe main goal of this research is to understand to which extent the classical Teichm\u00fcller theory generalizes to the higher rank. Some aspects include:\nthe study of diverging sequences of representations and the definition of the analogue of Thurston\u2019s boundary for higher rank Teichm\u00fcller spaces;\nthe analysis of equivariant harmonic maps from the universal cover of $S$ into the symmetric space $G/K$ and the real Euclidean building modeled on $\\mathfrak{g}$;\nthe definition of natural (pseudo)-Riemannian metrics on these higher Teichm\u00fcller components and the study of their global geometry.\nMembers\nAndrea Tamburelli\nandrea.tamburelli@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nJohn Loftin (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey)\nCharles Ouyang (University of Massachusetts, Amherst)\nMichael Wolf (Georgia Institute of Technology)\nHyperbolic geometry\nThe uniformisation of surfaces of Koebe and Poincar\u00e9 and the geometrisation of 3-manifolds of Thurston and Perelman have shown that every manifold of dimensions 2 and 3 admits a geometric structure (after cutting along some canonical spheres and tori in dimension 3). The prominent role among these geometric structures is played by hyperbolic geometry, that is by far the prevalent\nstructure. It is also the richest and most studied structure in dimensions 2 and 3.\nThe deformation spaces of hyperbolic 2- and 3-manifolds are the focus of a vast literature concerning Teichmueller spaces and hyperbolic fillings of open manifolds. Moreover, the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is a central topic in low-dimensional topology. But hyperbolic manifolds are abundant in any dimension, and a major goal is to understand their topology as well as their deformation spaces. To this aim, the members of the research group rely on many techniques, from the decomposition of manifolds into hyperbolic polytopes to the study of the topology of fibrations over the circle, to the investigation of the variety of representations of discrete groups into the Lie group of the isometries of hyperbolic space.\nMembers\nRoberto Frigerio\nroberto.frigerio@unipi.it\nViola Giovannini\nv.giovannini1@studenti.unipi.it\nBruno Martelli\nbruno.martelli@unipi.it\nCarlo Petronio\ncarlo.petronio@unipi.it\nCollaborators and Ph.D. students at other institutions\nJacopo Guoyi Chen (SNS, Pisa)\nGiovanni Italiano (SNS, Pisa)\nMatteo Migliorini (SNS, Pisa)\nLeone Slavich (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia)\nHyperplane arrangements\nThe group investigates the combinatorial and topological properties of hyperplane arrangements. From such a point of view, we study the theory of Coxeter groups (seen as reflection groups), Artin groups (seen as fundamental groups of the complements of reflection arrangements), and the computation of cohomology groups of the complements of hyperplane arrangements, both in the linear and the toric cases.\nTo obtain an explicit characterization of the cohomology ring of the complement of a toric arrangement, the group is studying wonderful compactifications of the complements. This approach allows the definition of a certain differential graded algebra, which \u2018governs\u2019 the cohomology ring.\nAt the moment, the group is interested in the following topics:\nthe $K(\\pi, 1)$ conjecture for all possible Coxeter groups and the corresponding hyperplane arrangements (for example, the affine simplicial arrangements, which are a natural generalization of the affine reflection arrangements);\nthe study of the so-called dual Coxeter groups, which depend on an element of the group and an interval formed by its divisors;\nthe study of combinatorial properties (such as the\nshellability\nproperty) for intervals as above;\nthe construction of an explicit basis of the integral ring cohomology of complements of toric arrangements and the explicit characterization of the corresponding differential graded algebra in specific examples.\nMembers\nFilippo Gianluca Callegaro\nfilippo.callegaro@unipi.it\nMichele D'Adderio\nmichele.dadderio@unipi.it\nGiovanni Gaiffi\ngiovanni.gaiffi@unipi.it\nMario Salvetti\nmario.salvetti@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nEmanuele Delucchi (Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana (SUPSI))\nemanuele.delucchi@supsi.ch\nRoberto Pagaria (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna)\nroberto.pagaria@unibo.it\nGiovanni Paolini (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna)\ng.paolini@unibo.it\nOscar Papini (ISTI -- CNR)\nViola Siconolfi (Politecnico di Bari)\nLorenzo Venturello (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Siena)\nLow-dimensional topology\nThis wide research area encompasses several subjects of interest for the research group.\nIn dimension 2, for example, we investigate the Hurwitz problem concerning the existence of branched covering between surfaces realizing a fixed combinatorial datum. To this aim, one may exploit Grothendieck\u2019s\ndessins d\u2019enfant\n, as well as the geometry of spherical, flat, and hyperbolic 2-orbifolds.\nIn dimension 3 some topics of interest for the group are the Heegaard-Floer homology of rational homology 3-spheres (with particular attention towards possible applications to the L-space conjecture) and the theory of knots and links in the sphere and in general 3-manifolds. A particular interest is devoted to Legendrian links, and to the study of Khovanov homology. 3-manifold topology is also involved in the study of apparent contours of surfaces in 3-space and in general 3-manifolds.\nThe topology of 4-manifolds is a very active research field, and the group is also interested in this area. Among the topics covered by the group, there are the study of handlebody decompositions of 4-manifolds, Heegaard-Floer homology, and\u00a0 3-dimensional knot theory from a 4-dimensional viewpoint.\nMembers\nFilippo Bianchi\nfilippo.bianchi@phd.unipi.it\nCarlo Collari\ncarlo.collari@dm.unipi.it\nPaolo Lisca\npaolo.lisca@unipi.it\nBruno Martelli\nbruno.martelli@unipi.it\nCarlo Petronio\ncarlo.petronio@unipi.it\nCollaborators and Ph.D. students at other institutions\nAlessio Di Prisa (SNS, Pisa)\nAlice Merz (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nalice.merz@phd.unipi.it\nSimplicial volume and bounded cohomology\nThe simplicial volume is a homotopy invariant of manifolds defined by Gromov in 1982. Despite its purely topological definition, it is deeply related to the geometric structures that a manifold can carry.\nThanks to Thurston\u2019s (now proved) Geometrization Conjecture, the simplicial volume of closed 3-manifolds is well understood. Much less is known in higher dimensions, or for open manifolds, and the group is interested in further investigating these research fields (with particular care devoted to aspherical manifolds).\nA powerful tool for the computation of the simplicial volume is the so-called bounded cohomology (of groups and of spaces), which is itself a very active research field. Computing the bounded cohomology of groups is very challenging (for example, the problem of whether it vanishes or not for free groups in degrees bigger than 3 is still open), and the research group aims at achieving some progress in this direction, as well as at studying the relationship between bounded cohomology and other related areas like representation theory, group actions on the circle, ergodic theory of groups.\nMembers\nRoberto Frigerio\nroberto.frigerio@unipi.it\nBruno Martelli\nbruno.martelli@unipi.it\nCollaborators and Ph.D. students at other institutions\nGiuseppe Bargagnati (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\ngiuseppe.bargagnati@phd.unipi.it\nFederica Bertolotti (SNS, Pisa)\nMichelle Bucher (Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve)\nPietro Capovilla (SNS, Pisa)\nClara Loeh (Universit\u00e4t Regensburg)\nclara.loeh@mathematik.uni-regensburg.de\nDomenico Marasco (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\ndomenico.marasco@phd.unipi.it\nFrancesco Milizia (SNS, Pisa)\nMarco Moraschini (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna)\nMaria Beatrice Pozzetti (Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg)\nRoman Sauer (Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie (KIT))\nAlessandro Sisto (Heriot-Watt University)\nPeople\nFaculty\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nMarco\nAbate\nmarco.abate@unipi.it\nFabrizio\nBianchi\nfabrizio.bianchi@unipi.it\nFilippo Gianluca\nCallegaro\nfilippo.callegaro@unipi.it\nDiego\nConti\ndiego.conti@unipi.it\nAndrea\nDi Lorenzo\nandrea.dilorenzo@unipi.it\nFilippo\nDisanto\nfilippo.disanto@unipi.it\nMarco\nFranciosi\nmarco.franciosi@unipi.it\nRoberto\nFrigerio\nroberto.frigerio@unipi.it\nPaolo\nLisca\npaolo.lisca@unipi.it\nSandro\nManfredini\nsandro.manfredini@unipi.it\nBruno\nMartelli\nbruno.martelli@unipi.it\nRita\nPardini\nrita.pardini@unipi.it\nGregory James\nPearlstein\ngreg.pearlstein@unipi.it\nEkaterina\nPervova\nekaterina.pervova@unipi.it\nCarlo\nPetronio\ncarlo.petronio@unipi.it\nFrancesco\nSala\nfrancesco.sala@unipi.it\nMario\nSalvetti\nmario.salvetti@unipi.it\nTam\u00e1s\nSzamuely\ntamas.szamuely@unipi.it\nMattia\nTalpo\nmattia.talpo@unipi.it\nAndrea\nTamburelli\nandrea.tamburelli@unipi.it\nAffiliate Members\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nFrancesca\nAcquistapace\nfrancesca.acquistapace@unipi.it\nRiccardo\nBenedetti\nriccardobenedetti53@gmail.com\nFabrizio\nBroglia\nbroglia@dm.unipi.it\nElisabetta\nFortuna\nelisabetta.fortuna@unipi.it\nFulvio\nLazzeri\nfulvio.lazzeri@unipi.it\nFormer Members\nName\nSurname\nFabrizio M.

It aims at discovering new algebraic structures (Lie algebras associated with curves) which should encode geometric properties of (moduli) spaces appearing in the so-called Riemann-Hilbert and the non-abelian Hodge correspondences for curves. We expect that this theory of Lie algebras associated with curves will unlock a new striking connection between geometry, algebra, and physics, which needs to be investigated further.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

Manifolds have been a central object of research in the last 150 years, and the study of the interplay between their geometry and topology is of primary importance. We subdivide our project in two areas, with large overlaps.\n\nGeometry:\nA central theme in the study of manifolds is the assignment and study of a geometric structure. The prominent role is played by hyperbolic geometry, but also various other structures may arise. We single out these directions of research:\n\na) Fibrations on hyperbolic manifolds of higher dimension;\n\nb) Deformations and rigidity of hyperbolic structures;\n\nc) Study of submanifolds;\n\nd) Complex hyperbolic manifolds, $H^{p,q}$ structures;\n\ne) Geometric group theory: Culler-Vogtmann Outer Space of free groups;\n\nf) Dynamics on moduli spaces;\n\ng) Circle packings.\n\n\nShortly, we aim to:\n\na) Construct and study fibrations in higher dimension;\n\nb) Study deformations and rigidity fenomena in dimension 3 and 4;\n\nc) Study geodesic immersions in the arithmetic and non-arithmetic setting;\n\nd) Study reflection groups and their deformations, and maximal embeddings in $H^{p,q}$;\n\ne) Solve decision problems as conjugacy and reducibility for automorphisms of free products;\n\nf) Study dynamics of flows on translation surfaces, billiards, fractals arising in dynamical settings;\n\ng) Rigidity of circle packings on projective surfaces of hyperbolic type.\n\nTopology:\nWe focus mostly on the topology of manifolds 2, 3, and 4. We single out these directions of research:\n1) Special handlebody decompositions of smooth 4-manifolds and non-symplectic embeddings of rational homology 4-balls;\n2) The Hurwitz existence problem for ramified covers between surfaces;\n3) Apparent contours of surfaces on flow-spines of 3-manifolds;\n4) Heegaard Floer homology, taut foliations and left-orderable groups;\n5) Poset homology and its applications in topology;\n6) Strongly invertible (Legendrian) links;\n7) Quasimorphisms and braid groups;\n8) Bounded cohomology and simplicial volume.\n\nShortly, we aim to:\n1) Understand some handlebody decompositions of smooth 4-manifolds and investigate their applications;\n2) Solve unsettled instances for length-2 partitions and more geometrically motivated ones;\n3) Develop reconstruction algorithms and combinatorial moves translating isotopy;\n4) Prove (or disprove) the L-space conjecture for large families of 3-manifolds;\n5) Investigate the properties of poset homologies and their applications in algebraic and low-dimensional topology;\n6) Define new invariants of strongly invertible links and strongly invertible Legendrian links and find potential applications;\n7) Define and study new quasimorphisms on braid groups and their subgroups and generalizations of Levine-Tristram signatures for classical links;\n8) Better understand geometric invariants via new computations.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

Moduli spaces, geometric and enumerative invariants, and deformations are the leading threads of the project, connecting the various directions in which it will develop. The different lines of investigations share several fundamental techniques and goals and they constitute a natural common ground for collaborations among the members of the project.\n\nThe main lines will be the following:\n1. Mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology: homological mirror symmetry for complete intersections in algebraic tori, logarithmic Calabi-Yau varieties and scattering diagrams, smoothing of toric Fano varieties, crepant resolution conjecture.\n\n2. Zero-dimensional Hilbert and Quot schemes and their motives, derived categories: motives of Quot schemes, generalized Hilbert-Chow morphisms, super-Nori motives.\n\n3. Deformations, Moduli, Hodge Theory: Moduli of Q-Gorenstein surfaces, Hodge theory of boundaries of moduli spaces of surfaces, degeneration of Calabi-Yau threefolds fibered by elliptic K3 surfaces, Severi varieties of nodal surfaces, moduli of quiver representations and applications.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

A geometric structure on a manifold is a way of measuring quantities that are invariant under a certain group of symmetries, the same way distances and angles do not change under rotations or translations. In many cases, on a fixed manifold, one can consider different geometric structures with the same underlying group of symmetries. The world of possible such structures is the moduli space. One example is the classic Teichmuller space that parametrizes metrics of constant negative curvature on certain two dimensional manifolds. Higher Teichmuller theory studies more general geometric structures on more complicated manifolds and their dynamical properties. This award provides funding for the research that focuses on fundamental questions in higher Teichmuller theory: how can we describe the geometry of these objects starting from the parameters in the moduli space? In particular, can we understand how these structures degenerate when the parameters leave all compact sets in the moduli space? Some numerical experiments related to this research will be carried out as undergraduate research supervised by the PI.\n\nThe PI plans to study geometric structures on low-dimensional manifolds with a rank 2 semi-simple Lie group of symmetries, such as anti-de Sitter, convex projective and Lorentzian conformally flat, using techniques from Higgs bundles, harmonic maps and representation theory. More precisely, the PI will study geometric limits of these structures when the parameters leave every compact set in the corresponding moduli spaces, with the aim of finding a (partial) compactification of these moduli spaces and give a geometric interpretation of the boundary points. A different line of research is related to a long-standing question by Gromov about existence and regularity of minimal area metrics on surfaces with a fixed systolic constraint, which he will investigate exploiting tools from convex optimization.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

The boundary conditions are overdetermined and might involve the trace of the function, its gradient (or just the normal derivative), and the curvature of the boundary. Solutions to free boundary problems are obtained for instance from the minimization of variational functionals that take into account both the state function (the solution of the PDE) and its domain of definition. Well-known examples of free boundary problems are the one-phase and the two-phase Bernoulli problems, the obstacle problem, the thin-obstacle problem, the optimal partitions problems, Mumford-Shah, free transmission problems, and their parabolic counterparts, for instance, the Stefan problem.\nThe focus is on the free boundary regularity theory, which is the study of the fine local structure of the free boundary and relates to the analysis of the interplay between the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the state function (the solution of the PDE). Of particular interest are theorems that guarantee (under some geometric conditions) that the boundary is a smooth manifold (the so-called epsilon-regularity theorems) and the analysis of the free boundaries around singularities. The methods include blow-up analysis, monotonicity formulas, density estimates, estimates on the dimension of the singular set, viscosity solutions, analysis of the stable cones, improvement-of-flatness methods, epiperimetric inequalities.\nThe free boundary problems are strongly related to problems in Geometric Analysis as the regularity of area-minimizing surfaces and currents; in Elliptic PDEs, for instance to the analysis of the nodal sets to the solutions of PDEs or the behavior at the boundary of the solutions (Boundary Harnack inequalities); and also to some Shape Optimization problems.\nMembers\nLuca Benatti\nluca.benatti@dm.unipi.it\nGiulia Bevilacqua\ngiulia.bevilacqua@dm.unipi.it\nMatteo Carducci\nmatteo.carducci@sns.it\nCarlo Gasparetto\ncarlo.gasparetto@dm.unipi.it\nRoberto Ognibene\nroberto.ognibene@dm.unipi.it\nFilippo Paiano\nfilippo.paiano@phd.unipi.it\nGiorgio Tortone\ngiorgio.tortone@dm.unipi.it\nBozhidar Velichkov\nbozhidar.velichkov@unipi.it\nCollaborators and Ph.D. students at other institutions\nGuido De Philippis (Courant Institute of Mathematics)\nLorenzo Ferreri (SNS, Pisa)\nlorenzo.ferreri@sns.it\nDario Mazzoleni (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia)\ndario.mazzoleni@unipv.it\nLuca Spolaor (University of California San Diego)\nlspolaor@ucsd.edu\nSusanna Terracini (Universit\u00e0 di Torino)\nGeometric flows\nThe idea of deforming a geometric object by means of a parabolic PDEs to simplify it (e.g. to reduce its topological complexity or to make it more symmetric) goes back to Eells and Sampson who introduced the first geometric evolution equation: the harmonic map flow. Since 1964, geometric flows have been applied to a variety of topological, analytical, and physical problems, giving in some cases very fruitful results.\nAmong other geometric equations, we mention the mean curvature flow. This flow can be regarded as the gradient flow of the area functional: an n-dimensional time-dependent surface evolves with normal velocity its mean curvature, at any point and time. In place of the area functional, one may consider generalized perimeters, such as the fractional perimeter, and the corresponding gradient flows. Concerning the study of these flows, we are interested in the long-time existence of (weak and strong) solutions and in the classification of possible singularities. Besides the urge to introduce a non-local version of mean curvature flow, one wants also to extend it to the more singular geometric objects.\nMotived by the study of grain boundaries, Brakke introduces the first weak versions of the flow and in the years a plethora of weak definitions (level set approach, minimizing movements, thresholding scheme, canonical Brakke flow) has been developed, but the one-dimensional version of this problem is also studied in the framework of classical PDEs. In such a situation the flow is called network flow.\nWe are interested in several aspects of evolution: well-posedness, long-time behavior, analysis of singularities, flow past singularities, and stability. Our main goal is to exploit the known results to a higher dimension.\nMembers\nMatteo Novaga\nmatteo.novaga@unipi.it\nAlessandra Pluda\nalessandra.pluda@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nAnnalisa Cesaroni (Universit\u00e0 di Padova)\nAntonin Chambolle (Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine)\nCarlo Mantegazza (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II)\nRafe Mazzeo (Stanford University)\nMassimiliano Morini (Universit\u00e0 di Parma)\nmassimiliano.morini@unipr.it\nMarcello Ponsiglione (Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma)\nMarco Pozzetta (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II)\nmarco.pozzetta@gmail.com\nMariel Saez (Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile)\nGeometric measure theory\nThe development of Geometric Measure Theory (GMT) began about one hundred years ago, with the first intrinsic notions of dimension for general sets, which could be possibly non-integer, and the corresponding intrinsic notions of measure, where \u201cintrinsic\u201d means that it does not rely on parametrizations.\nIn the second half of the last century, one of the driving problems was the existence of d-dimensional surfaces with minimal area and prescribed boundary (Plateau problem), which led to the development of several \u201cweak\u201d notions of surface, such as finite perimeter set (Caccioppoli, De Giorgi), integral currents (Federer and Fleming), and varifolds (Almgren).\nIn the past fifty years these notions played a fundamental role in the treatment of many problems of geometric nature besides minimal surfaces, from the asymptotic behavior of singular perturbations problems in continuum mechanics and physics (e.g, scalar and vector models of Ginzburg-Landau type) to the notions of weak solutions of geometric evolution problems (e.g., the mean curvature flow).\nAt the same time, many attempts have been made to extend these theories to various non-Euclidean settings (sub-Riemannian manifolds and metric spaces with bounds on curvature). These attempts have led to several fundamental questions that have not yet been fully answered\u2013indeed in many cases our understanding is still quite limited.\nThe Italian mathematical community in Calculus of Variations and Geometric Measure Theory, whose origins can be traced back to the work of Ennio De Giorgi here in Pisa, gave essential contributions to the developments mentioned above. Among the topics currently studied in our department, we mention the following:\nGMT in sub-Riemannian manifolds: area formulas, contact sets, currents;\nMinimal partitions;\nGauss-Green formulas, sets of finite perimeter and rectifiability in stratified Lie groups;\nWeak solutions to geometric evolution problems;\nStructure of measures and differentiability of Lipschitz functions.\nMembers\nGiovanni Alberti\ngiovanni.alberti@unipi.it\nValentino Magnani\nvalentino.magnani@unipi.it\nMatteo Novaga\nmatteo.novaga@unipi.it\nEmanuele Paolini\nemanuele.paolini@unipi.it\nEugene Stepanov\nevgeny.stepanov@unipi.it\nVincenzo Maria Tortorelli\nvincenzo.tortorelli@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nDavid Bate (University of Warwick)\ndavid.bate@warwick.ac.uk\nMarianna Csornyei (University of Chicago)\ncsornyei@math.uchicago.edu\nAndrea Marchese (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trento)\nandrea.marchese@unitn.it\nAnnalisa Massaccesi (Universit\u00e0 di Padova)\nannalisa.massaccesi@unipd.it\nAndrea Merlo (Universidad del Pa\u00eds Vasco)\nmerlo.andrea92@gmail.com\nDavid Preiss (University of Warwick)\nd.preiss@warwick.ac.uk\nShape optimization\nThe field of shape optimization had very strong growth in the last decades, mainly due to the several applications in engineering, but also for the mathematical interest related to several problems in spectral geometry. The goal is to find a domain $\\Omega$ that minimizes a given cost functional, that may involve geometrical quantities as perimeter or measure, as well as other quantities related to PDEs like for instance the related energies or eigenvalues. Showing the existence of optimal shapes, and their regularity is often a very challenging issue that needs the development of new and deep tools.\nMembers\nGiuseppe Buttazzo\ngiuseppe.buttazzo@unipi.it\nIlaria Lucardesi\nilaria.lucardesi@unipi.it\nAldo Pratelli\naldo.pratelli@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nGuy Bouchitt\u00e9 (Universit\u00e9 de Toulon)\nLorenzo Brasco (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Ferrara)\nLuca Briani Medeiros Dos Santo (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM))\nluca.briani@phd.unipi.it\nJuan Casado-Diaz (Universidad de Sevilla)\njcasadod@us.es\nThierry Champion (Universit\u00e9 de Toulon)\nLuigi De Pascale (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze)\nAntoine Henrot (Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine)\nFaustino Maestre (Universidad de Sevilla)\nfmaestre@us.es\nFrancesca Agnese Prinari (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nMichiel van den Berg (University of Bristol)\nPDEs, ODEs, and dynamical systems\nMembers\nJacopo Bellazzini\njacopo.bellazzini@unipi.it\nLuigi Carlo Berselli\nluigi.carlo.berselli@unipi.it\nCarlo Carminati\ncarlo.carminati@unipi.it\nElisabetta Chiodaroli\nelisabetta.chiodaroli@unipi.it\nLuigi Forcella\nluigi.forcella@unipi.it\nStefano Galatolo\nstefano.galatolo@unipi.it\nMarco Gipo Ghimenti\nmarco.ghimenti@unipi.it\nMarina Ghisi\nmarina.ghisi@unipi.it\nMassimo Gobbino\nmassimo.gobbino@unipi.it\nCarlo Romano Grisanti\ncarlo.romano.grisanti@unipi.it\nFrancesco Grotto\nfrancesco.grotto@unipi.it\nVladimir Simeonov Gueorguiev\nvladimir.simeonov.gueorguiev@unipi.it\nPietro Majer\npietro.majer@unipi.it\nMario Rastrelli\nmario.rastrelli@phd.unipi.it\nClaudio Saccon\nclaudio.saccon@unipi.it\nNicola Visciglia\nnicola.visciglia@unipi.it\nBelow is the list of the specific topics studied in this research area, each of them with a detailed description and the lists of members and collaborators.\nDynamical systems and ergodic theory\nOur research focuses on the statistical properties of deterministic and random dynamical systems.\nThese studies have a wide range of applications, from a number of theoretical and geometrical questions to the understanding of the behavior of models of real-world phenomena like the dynamics of fluids, the evolution of climate and its extreme events, the dynamics of extended systems in a mean-field coupling and other complex systems.

The methods we use stem from those of classical analysis of PDEs in Sobolev spaces, but for the problems we consider we are using also: convex integration, analysis in Orlicz, weighted spaces, and approximate methods like reduced-order ones. More specifically for the Equations of classical fluid mechanics: incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Existence, uniqueness, properties, and regularity of weak and suitable solutions.\nConcerning non-Newtonian fluids, we are interested in the existence, regularity, numerical approximation, and long-time behavior of classes of p-fluids or electrorheological ones.\nFor the turbulent flows, we study the mathematical properties and the mathematical modeling of such methods, having in mind the application to the study of boundary layers and air-sea interaction, together with other multi-phase problems arising in the study of volcanic eruptions.\nMembers\nLuigi Carlo Berselli\nluigi.carlo.berselli@unipi.it\nElisabetta Chiodaroli\nelisabetta.chiodaroli@unipi.it\nCarlo Romano Grisanti\ncarlo.romano.grisanti@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nMatteo Cerminara (SNS, Pisa)\nFrancesca Crispo (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\")\nCamillo De Lellis (Institute for Advanced Study)\nEduard Feireisl (Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences)\nfeireisl@math.cas.cz\nOndrej Kreml (Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences)\nRoger Lewandowski (Universit\u00e9 de Rennes)\nRoger.Lewandowski@univ-rennes1.fr\nPaolo Maremonti (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\")\nMichael R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka (Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg)\nStefano Spirito (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'Aquila)\nstefano.spirito@univaq.it\nAthanasios Tzavaras (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST))\nEmil Wiedemann (Universit\u00e4t Ulm)\nHyperbolic Equations, dispersive equations, and Kirchhoff equations\nMembers\nJacopo Bellazzini\njacopo.bellazzini@unipi.it\nLuigi Forcella\nluigi.forcella@unipi.it\nMarina Ghisi\nmarina.ghisi@unipi.it\nVladimir Simeonov Gueorguiev\nvladimir.simeonov.gueorguiev@unipi.it\nMario Rastrelli\nmario.rastrelli@phd.unipi.it\nNicola Visciglia\nnicola.visciglia@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nDaniele Barbera (Politecnico di Torino)\ndaniele.barbera96@gmail.com\nNicolas Burq (Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Saclay)\nTohru Ozawa (Waseda University)\nFabrice Planchon (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9)\nDavid Ruiz (Universidad de Granada)\nNikolay Tzvetkov (\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon)\nDinh Van Duong (\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon)\nNonlinear analysis\nThe nonlinear analysis group focuses on partial differential equations of elliptic and hyperbolic types in which the presence of the nonlinear term is crucial for the existence and qualitative properties of solutions.\nThe research interests span from nonlinear Schroedinger equations and Gross-Pitaevskij in a Euclidean setting to Yamabe problems on compact manifolds.

Another field of research is related to functional inequalities in presence of nonlocal terms: the existence of maximizers and the role of symmetry.\nMembers\nJacopo Bellazzini\njacopo.bellazzini@unipi.it\nMarco Gipo Ghimenti\nmarco.ghimenti@unipi.it\nPietro Majer\npietro.majer@unipi.it\nAnna Maria Micheletti\na.micheletti@dma.unipi.it\nCollaborators\nM\u00f3nica Clapp (Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico)\nPietro D'Avenia (Politecnico di Bari)\nSimone Dovetta (Politecnico di Torino)\nLouis Jeanjean (Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9)\nEnno Lenzmann (Universit\u00e4t Basel)\nVitaly Moroz (Swansea University)\nAngela Pistoia (Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma)\nDavid Ruiz (Universidad de Granada)\nJean Van Schaftingen (Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain)\nPeople\nFaculty\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nGiovanni\nAlberti\ngiovanni.alberti@unipi.it\nAdolfo\nArroyo Rabasa\nadolfo.rabasa@unipi.it\nJacopo\nBellazzini\njacopo.bellazzini@unipi.it\nLuigi Carlo\nBerselli\nluigi.carlo.berselli@unipi.it\nGiuseppe\nButtazzo\ngiuseppe.buttazzo@unipi.it\nCarlo\nCarminati\ncarlo.carminati@unipi.it\nElisabetta\nChiodaroli\nelisabetta.chiodaroli@unipi.it\nLuigi\nForcella\nluigi.forcella@unipi.it\nStefano\nGalatolo\nstefano.galatolo@unipi.it\nMaria Stella\nGelli\nmaria.stella.gelli@unipi.it\nMarco Gipo\nGhimenti\nmarco.ghimenti@unipi.it\nMarina\nGhisi\nmarina.ghisi@unipi.it\nMassimo\nGobbino\nmassimo.gobbino@unipi.it\nCarlo Romano\nGrisanti\ncarlo.romano.grisanti@unipi.it\nFrancesco\nGrotto\nfrancesco.grotto@unipi.it\nVladimir Simeonov\nGueorguiev\nvladimir.simeonov.gueorguiev@unipi.it\nIlaria\nLucardesi\nilaria.lucardesi@unipi.it\nValentino\nMagnani\nvalentino.magnani@unipi.it\nPietro\nMajer\npietro.majer@unipi.it\nMatteo\nNovaga\nmatteo.novaga@unipi.it\nEmanuele\nPaolini\nemanuele.paolini@unipi.it\nNicola\nPicenni\nnicola.picenni@unipi.it\nAlessandra\nPluda\nalessandra.pluda@unipi.it\nAldo\nPratelli\naldo.pratelli@unipi.it\nClaudio\nSaccon\nclaudio.saccon@unipi.it\nEugene\nStepanov\nevgeny.stepanov@unipi.it\nVincenzo Maria\nTortorelli\nvincenzo.tortorelli@unipi.it\nBozhidar\nVelichkov\nbozhidar.velichkov@unipi.it\nNicola\nVisciglia\nnicola.visciglia@unipi.it\nAffiliate Members\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nPaolo\nAcquistapace\npaolo.acquistapace@unipi.it\nHugo\nBeirao da Veiga\nbveiga@dma.unipi.it\nFerruccio\nColombini\nferruccio.colombini@unipi.it\nAdele\nManes\nadele.manes@unipi.it\nAnna Maria\nMicheletti\na.micheletti@dma.unipi.it\nGiuseppe\nPuglisi\ngiuseppe.puglisi@unipi.it\nSergio\nSpagnolo\nspagnolo@dm.unipi.it\nAntonio\nTarsia\ntarsia@dm.unipi.it\nFormer Members\nthere is no data\nPostdoctoral Fellows\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nLuca\nBenatti\nluca.benatti@dm.unipi.it\nGiulia\nBevilacqua\ngiulia.bevilacqua@dm.unipi.it\nCarlo\nGasparetto\ncarlo.gasparetto@dm.unipi.it\nMichele\nGorini\nmichele.gorini@dm.unipi.it\nFrancesco\nNobili\nfrancesco.nobili@dm.unipi.it\nRoberto\nOgnibene\nroberto.ognibene@dm.unipi.it\nGiorgio\nTortone\ngiorgio.tortone@dm.unipi.it\nLiangjun\nWeng\nliangjun.weng@dm.unipi.it\nPh.D. Students at the University of Pisa\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nRyunosuke\nKusaba\nryu2411501@akane.waseda.jp\nJeremy\nMirmina\njeremy.mirmina@phd.unipi.it\nFilippo\nPaiano\nfilippo.paiano@phd.unipi.it\nMario\nRastrelli\nmario.rastrelli@phd.unipi.it\nKenta\nTomioka\nkenta.tomioka@phd.unipi.it\nPh.D. Students at other institutions\nName\nSurname\nAffiliation\nDavide\nCarazzato\nSNS, Pisa\nMatteo\nCarducci\nSNS, Pisa\nTommaso\nCortopassi\nSNS, Pisa\nLorenzo\nFerreri\nSNS, Pisa\nFran\u00e7ois\nLegeais\nUniversit\u00e9 de Rennes\nJoao Enrique\nLirio\nUniversidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro\nPh.D. Theses supervised by members of the group\nawarded by the University of Pisa\nYear\nName\nSurname\nTitle of the Thesis\nSupervisor(s)\n2024\nLuciano\nSciaraffia Rubio\nNetworks: existence of minimal configurations and curvature flow singularities\nAndrea  Malchiodi and\nMatteo  Novaga\n2024\nDaniele\nBarbera\nThe Beris-Edwards and the Ericksen-Leslie Models for Nematic Liquid Crystals\nVladimir Simeonov  Gueorguiev\nand Kousuke  Kuto and Yoshihiro  Shibata\n2023\nKonstantinos\nBessas\nNonlocal Models in Calculus of Variations\nMatteo  Novaga\n2023\nLuca\nBriani Medeiros Dos Santo\nShape optimization problems with competing terms\nGiuseppe  Buttazzo\n2022\nVincenzo\nScattaglia\nOn the isoperimetric problem with density for clusters\nAldo  Pratelli\n2021\nLuigi\nMarangio\nRigorous computational methods for understanding the statistical behavior of random dynamical systems.\nStefano  Galatolo\nand Christophe  Guyeux\n2021\nObinna Kennedy\nIdu\nHigher order rectifiability criteria and a model for soap films\nGiovanni  Alberti\n2020\nMarco\nPozzetta\nWillmore-type energies of curves and surfaces\nMatteo  Novaga\n2019\nFrancesco\nBartaloni\nInfinite horizon optimal control problems with non-compact control space.

Asymptotic behavior of solutions of competing systems, analysis of nodal sets, and spectral properties of singularly perturbed problems. This includes the regularity of interfaces in phase-separation models and optimal partition problems, the study of nodal sets for solutions to elliptic problems, and the qualitative and quantitative analysis of spectral properties under singular perturbation of the reference domain.\n\nB. Shape optimization and free-boundary problems, with a focus on shape optimization problems coming from electrodynamics and quantum models with aggregation/scattering competition, and on biological models with various type of diffusion.\n\nC. Theoretical aspect of nonlinear elliptic problems, with a focus on three prototypical problems: existence and properties of critical points for nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations on various type of domains, or even on networks; blow-up phenomena or compactness of solutions for Yamabe-type equations; regularity theory for the mean curvature equation in Lorentz Minkowski space.\n\nD. Nonlocal geometric problems, with a focus on the regularity theory for nonlocal minimal surfaces, the classification of entire solutions of the fractional Allen-Cahn equation, and the analysis of the nonlocal mean curvature flow, both from the point of view of the regularity, and from the point of view of the long-time behavior.\n\nIn each point, we wish to understand the theoretical aspects, and their possible impact on the model. A main feature of this project stays in the fact that, despite the variety of problems we plan to attack, there is a remarkable methodological unity. The different issues all require mastery in variational methods and critical points theory, regularity and qualitative theory for elliptic and parabolic equations, blow-up analysis and monotonicity formulas, geometric measure theory.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

In particular, the proposal concerns the classical systems of isentropic Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, and aims at establishing new and fundamental results which will have a major impact in the community of Applied Partial Differential Equations. The specific objectives of the proposal concern the existence of weak solutions for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density dependent coefficients in configurations with vacuum, the existence of dissipative H\u00f6lder solutions to the compressible isentropic Euler equations and the existence of pathological non unique weak solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations, which will extend to the compressible world groundbreaking results recently obtained in the context of incompressible fluids. Among the main tools which will be developed in the present proposal there will be a new designed convex integration scheme for compressible fluids and a suitable adaptation of the theory of renormalized solutions for transport and continuity equations with non-smooth vector fields in the context of compressible fluids.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

The common background of all participants involved in this project led in a natural way to the formation of our research units and to the formulation of the present research program, divided in three main themes: geometric evolution problems and curvature flows of network, capillarity problems and isoperimetric inequalities, shape optimization. All these topics are strictly intertwined and share a large amount of techniques coming from Calculus of Variations, the Regularity theory of PDEs and Geometric Measure Theory. Moreover, apart from their intrinsic mathematical interest, some of the problems we intend to study originate from well known models developed in the fields of Materials Science and Structural Engineering.\n\n1.

The EU-funded VAREG project plans to study free boundary problems from a purely theoretical point of view. The focus will be on the regularity of the free boundaries arising in the context of variational minimisation problems such as the one-phase, the two-phase and the vectorial Bernoulli problems as well as the obstacle and thin-obstacle problems. The project will develop new techniques for analysing the fine structure of the free boundaries, especially around singularities. Many tools and methods developed can find application in other problems and domains, including area-minimising surfaces, harmonic maps, free-discontinuity problems and parabolic and non-local free boundary problems.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

The detailed activity of the group can be found\nhere\n.\nThe group runs a Seminar Series: more info can be found at this\nlink\n.\nResearch Topics\nStochastic evolutions\nThe research activity is concentrated on problems of existence, regularity, statistical asymptotic behaviour, and the analysis of relevant properties of solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations with random components, with emphasis on equations from fluid dynamics. The interest spans also ordinary differential equations with non-regular coefficients, partial differential equations without uniqueness or with blow-up, and corresponding regularization properties due to noise. Problems of interacting particle systems arising from models of cortices are also considered, as well as dynamical and asymptotic properties of piecewise deterministic Markov processes.\nMembers\nAndrea Agazzi\nandrea.agazzi@unipi.it\nFrancesco Grotto\nfrancesco.grotto@unipi.it\nMario Maurelli\nmario.maurelli@unipi.it\nAikaterini Papagiannouli\naikaterini.papagiannouli@unipi.it\nMarco Romito\nmarco.romito@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nFranco Flandoli (SNS, Pisa)\nfranco.flandoli@gmail.com\nCarina Geldhauser (Lund University)\nJonathan Mattingly (Duke University)\nUmberto Pappalettera (SNS, Pisa)\nProbabilistic methods in statistical learning\nIn recent years deep learning, through neural networks, has had an enormous impact on the development of artificial intelligence and on its possible applications. This remarkable success though has not been fully matched by theoretical results that could provide justifications of its efficacy or hints for improvements, or identify possible limitations, as well as construct methods to interpret its results. The research activity of the group in this direction is devoted to the analysis of the interaction between artificial neural networks and the theory of Gaussian processes, to the optimality and convergence of learning dynamics for neural networks, in different asymptotic regimes, to the analysis of stochastic gradient descent algorithms, to Bayes statistics for dynamical systems and reinforcement learning.\nMembers\nAndrea Agazzi\nandrea.agazzi@unipi.it\nAikaterini Papagiannouli\naikaterini.papagiannouli@unipi.it\nMarco Romito\nmarco.romito@unipi.it\nDario Trevisan\ndario.trevisan@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nJianfeng Lu (Duke University)\nSayan Mukherjee (Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften)\nMaurizio Parton (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi \u201cGabriele D\u2019Annunzio\u201d Chieti - Pescara)\nVariational problems in commutative and non-commutative probability\nThe main interests of this subject are analysis in Gaussian spaces, in particular Malliavin calculus, inequalities for random variables and their densities, entropic inequalities, and indeterminacy principles, in both commutative and non-commutative (quantum) settings. Other topics of interest are random optimal transportation problems, laws of large numbers for empirical measures of interacting particles, and combinatorial optimization problems in Euclidean random models.\nMembers\nDario Trevisan\ndario.trevisan@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nGian Maria Dall\u2019Ara (SNS, Pisa, INdAM)\nGiacomo De Palma (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna)\nMichael Goldman (CNRS, \u00c9cole Polytechnique)\nmichael.goldman@cnrs.fr\nMartin Huesmann (Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster)\nStochastic processes for chemical reactions networks\nThe analysis is devoted to problems of large deviations for jump processes, and to structural stability conditions for their stability. The main themes in this analysis are averaging methods, duality for Markov processes, and variational inequalities. The focus is given to reaction-diffusion processes, propagation of chaos for systems of interacting particles, and to variational structures in discrete spaces, with emphasis on the out-of-equilibrium regime.\nMembers\nAndrea Agazzi\nandrea.agazzi@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nDavid Anderson (University of Wisconsin-Madison)\nDaniele Cappelletti (Politecnico di Torino)\nJonathan Mattingly (Duke University)\nPeople\nFaculty\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nAndrea\nAgazzi\nandrea.agazzi@unipi.it\nMario\nMaurelli\nmario.maurelli@unipi.it\nAikaterini\nPapagiannouli\naikaterini.papagiannouli@unipi.it\nMarco\nRomito\nmarco.romito@unipi.it\nDario\nTrevisan\ndario.trevisan@unipi.it\nAffiliate Members\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nRita\nGiuliano\nrita.giuliano@unipi.it\nGiorgio\nLetta\ngiorgio.letta@unipi.it\nMaurizio\nPratelli\nmaurizio.pratelli@unipi.it\nFormer Members\nName\nSurname\nGiacomo Filippo\nDi Ges\u00f9\nFranco\nFlandoli\nPostdoctoral Fellows\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nSotirios\nKotitsas\nSotirios.Kotitsas@warwick.ac.uk\nPh.D. Students at the University of Pisa\nName\nSurname\nEmail\nPersonal Card\nEloy\nMosig\neloy.mosig@phd.unipi.it\nLeonardo\nRoveri\nleonardo.roveri@phd.unipi.it\nSamuele\nSaviozzi\nsamuele.saviozzi@phd.unipi.it\nPh.D. Students at other institutions\nthere is no data\nPh.D. Theses supervised by members of the group\nawarded by the University of Pisa\nYear\nName\nSurname\nTitle of the Thesis\nSupervisor(s)\n2017\nValeria\nDe Mattei\nNew approaches to Mean Field Game Theory\nFranco  Flandoli\n2008\nAnnalisa\nCastellucci\n$\\phi$-Subgaussian random processes: properties and their applications\nRita  Giuliano\n1999\nGiovanni\nBecchere\nValuation and hedging of American options in incomplete markets: minimum risk strategies\nMaurizio  Pratelli\nawarded by another institution\nthere is no data\nGrants\nCurrent\nDipartimento di Eccellenza 2023-2027\n(Progetto Ministeriale Nazionale)\nCoordinator of the Research Unit:\nMatteo Novaga\nProject period:\nJan 01, 2023 \u2013 Dec 31, 2027\nConvergence and Stability of Reaction and Interaction Network Dynamics (ConStRAINeD)\n(Prin 2022)\nPrincipal Investigator:\nDaniele Cappelletti\nCoordinator of the Research Unit:\nAndrea Agazzi\nProject period:\nSep 28, 2023 \u2013 Sep 27, 2025\nUnderstanding the LEarning process of QUantum Neural networks (LeQun)\n(Prin 2022)\nPrincipal Investigator:\nGiacomo De Palma\nCoordinator of the Research Unit:\nDario Trevisan\nProject period:\nSep 28, 2023 \u2013 Sep 27, 2025\nNoise in fluid dynamics and related models\n(Prin 2022)\nPrincipal Investigator:\nFranco Flandoli\nCoordinator of the Research Unit:\nMarco Romito\nProject period:\nSep 28, 2023 \u2013 Sep 27, 2025\nAPRISE -

The state space is the number of available individuals of different kinds, and transitions are encoded by a finite set of allowed reactions, which can be arranged as the edges of a reaction graph. SRNs are often used as models in biochemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. The aim of ConStRAINeD is to provide new theoretical insights on SRNs which are crucial to unlock a deeper understanding in important applications. ConStRAINeD has two main objectives, listed below.\n\nObjective 1: developing theorems connecting the structure of the reaction graph with the positive recurrence of the model, as well as with an exact description of the stationary distributions.\n\nObjective 2: extending the setting of SRN to cases in which spatial positions of particles are taken into account by introducing a random graph of interaction and diffusion dynamics. The effect that this has on the large volume dynamics will be studied.\n\nThe objectives mainly involve theorems based on the structure of the reaction or the interaction graph and therefore independent on the specific rate parameters. This choice is motivated by the fact that the exact rates of changes in biological, epidemiological or ecological systems are rarely known with precision. Hence, results that hold for a large class of parameters are both impactful and mathematically interesting.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

Determining the problems on which quantum computers can provide major advantages with respect to classical computers is the main theoretical problem of quantum computing and constitutes the challenge that LeQun addresses.\nThe most promising family of quantum algorithms that can be implemented on the forthcoming generation of quantum computers are variational quantum algorithms, also called quantum neural networks. Despite the promises, there is no problem of practical interest yet where quantum neural networks have a provable advantage over the best classical algorithms. A thorough theoretical study of the trainability, expressibility and generalization properties of quantum neural networks and of their potential advantages with respect to classical computers constitutes the main theoretical challenge of quantum machine learning.\nLeQun will tackle this extremely ambitious challenge through the following objectives:\n\nO1:\n- To analytically characterize the probability distribution of the functions generated by trained quantum neural networks and determine their trainability and generalization performances.\n\n- To study the training stability against imperfect outcomes of quantum measurements and the query complexity of the entire training process, namely the number of measurements that must be performed to achieve the desired accuracy.\n\nO2:\n- To identify the architectures of quantum neural networks that have the potential to provide major advantages with respect to classical computers and to perform a proof-of-principle validation of the advantages of the identified architectures using realquantum devices and simulators.\n\nLeQun will tackle the challenge with an interdisciplinary approach that connects quantum machine learning with probability theory and quantum many-body physics. The strategy of LeQun is based on the recent breakthrough results in classical machine learning stating that in the mean-field limit of infinite width of the hidden layers, trained deep neural networks are equivalent to Gaussian processes. These results explained the unreasonably good performances of deep neural networks, and LeQun will generalize them to the quantum setting.\n\nLeQun will constitute a successful example of interdisciplinary research and will foster a cross-fertilization among quantum computing, probability theory and many-body quantum physics. The results of LeQun will be highly relevant for all the researchers working on quantum computing and machine learning both in industry and academia, thus contributing to creating value for the whole society, and its results will constitute a fundamental contribution to the main challenge of quantum computing.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

However, with the awareness of its extreme difficulty and the relatively short time span of the project compared to such an outstanding problem, the project has been diversified in several side themes of great independent interest, some of them originated precisely from the main question above. The expected contribution of the project will mostly be the advancement of the theories which are behind the main question of well posedness of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations.\nThe project is therefore organized along two main directions summarized in two WorkPackages, WP1 and WP2, with several milestones indicating the expected outcomes of the activity. \nWP1 is devoted to Regularization by Noise. Some of the milestones are specifically addressed to 3D fluid mechanics and have to do with the impact of a stretching noise on vector fields. Other milestones have to do with more general questions like the regularization properties of rough deterministic inputs, the role of Kolmogorov equation and its regularity theory both in questions of uniqueness and blow-up, application of methodologies like the regularity of Kolmogorov equations to specific models of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations.\nWP2 is devoted to a broad range of questions in Stochastic Fluid Mechanics. Some of them are directly linked to the regularization by noise methodologies but find place in WP2 because they are important also for other reasons, like the understanding of turbulence: an example is the concept of eddy viscosity. Other milestones have to do with specific models of fluid mechanics like point vortices, whose dynamics and statistics are very important in turbulence theory and in the approximation of deterministic and stochastic fluid equations. Further ones have to do with properties of the law of the solutions and the invariant measures of equations, touching also problems like the inviscid limit and some questions of boundary layers.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

The BepiColombo mission was launched in 2018 and will arrive in orbit around Mercury in 2025: it aims to study the planet\u2019s gravity field, its composition, its state of rotation, and carry out tests on theories of gravitation. The Celestial Mechanics group will analyze the data from the radio science experiment with the dedicated software Orbit14, developed with ASI funding in 2007. Simulations and cruise data analysis are currently being carried out. The Juno mission was launched in 2011 and has been in orbit around Jupiter since 2016: it aims to study the origin and evolution of the planet. The Celestial Mechanics Group is responsible for analyzing the data from the radio science experiment with the dedicated software Orbit14 with the aim of estimating Jupiter\u2019s physical parameters, including gravitational and tidal coefficients. These parameters are necessary to improve the internal structure models of the planet. The Hera mission will be launched in 2024 and the goal will be the binary asteroid Didymos which it will reach in 2026, a few years after the moon of Didymos, called Dimorphos, was impacted by DART probe of NASA. Hera\u2019s purpose is to characterize the post-impact environment of the asteroid through different tools. The Celestial Mechanics group will develop software, based on Orbit14, to analyze radio science data and will also conduct an analysis of the non-gravitational perturbations acting on the system (Yarkovsky-YORP-BYORP effects).\nMembers\nMiriam Falletta\nmiriam.falletta@phd.unipi.it\nGiacomo Lari\ngiacomo.lari@unipi.it\nMaddalena Mochi\nmaddalena.mochi@phd.unipi.it\nRoberto Paoli\nroberto.paoli@dm.unipi.it\nGiacomo Tommei\ngiacomo.tommei@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nGiulia Schettino (IFAC -- CNR)\nDaniele Serra (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\ndaniele.serra.ds@gmail.com\nOrbit determination (OD)\nThe Celestial Mechanics Group (CMG) boasts more than thirty years of experience in the dynamics and orbit determination of minor bodies of the solar system, e.g. Main Belt Asteroids (MBAs) and Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Such work led to the realization of the online services AstDyS (it contains data about numbered and multi-opposition asteroids, including for example their orbital elements with the related uncertainties and proper elements) and NEODyS (it contains data about NEAs, including close approaches information, and probabilities of impact with the Earth). Since 2006 the CMG has also been involved in research in the field of space debris. In these broad fields of research, a non-exhaustive list of sub-topics is the following.\nNew initial OD methods for very short arcs of observations: this problem arises from the fact that the next-generation surveys (e.g. Pan-STARRS, LSST) will be able to gather a huge number of observations of small celestial bodies per night.\nClassification of the asteroid families in the Main Belt.\nImpact Monitoring (IM) of NEAs: the goal of IM is to establish, starting from observations, if a given NEA could have a chance to impact the Earth in the future. Such algorithms have been implemented in the CLOMON2 software (since 2002), which daily processes observational data from observers around the world by calculating the orbits of objects and their uncertainty. In the last ten years the NEOScan software has been developed: it analyzes the NEOCP data (where there are objects with very few observations) to determine the type of object and, in the case of a NEA, evaluate possible imminent impacts.\nChaotic OD: it is the problem of determining the state and the associated uncertainty of a chaotic dynamical system from a set of observations. In particular, we want to understand the behavior of the uncertainty as the number of observations grows and how it changes if a dynamical parameter is included among the variables to be determined; such analysis is applied to celestial bodies that undergo several close encounters with planets or planets\u2019 satellites.\nCorrelation and OD for space debris.\nCollision avoidance of space debris: we study the problem of finding in a given time interval (usually a few days) which pairs of space debris orbiting around the Earth can become sufficiently close to each other, providing also the probability of this event. Due to the big number of space debris present in the catalog, filters are necessary to quickly discard many pairs of objects. One of these filters consists of a new procedure to speed up the computation of the minimum distance between two confocal comics.\nMembers\nGiulio Ba\u00f9\ngiulio.bau@unipi.it\nClara Grassi\nclara.grassi@dm.unipi.it\nGiovanni Federico Gronchi\ngiovanni.federico.gronchi@unipi.it\nGiacomo Lari\ngiacomo.lari@unipi.it\nGiacomo Tommei\ngiacomo.tommei@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nRobert Jedicke (University of Hawaii)\njedicke@hawaii.edu\nZoran Kne\u017eevi\u0107 (Astronomical Observatory Belgrade)\nzoran@aob.rs\nErica Scantamburlo (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nerica.scantamburlo.93@gmail.com\nFederica Spoto (Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian)\nfederica.spoto@cfa.harvard.edu\nGiovanni Valsecchi (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, Osservatorio Astrofisico di Torino)\nGiovanni.Valsecchi@iaps.inaf.it\nSolar system dynamics and astrodynamics\nLong-term evolution of satellites\u2019 dynamics driven by tidal dissipation. Dissipative effects due to tidal forces between satellites and their hosting planet influence greatly the dynamics and the interior of the moons. For example, the volcanism of the moon Io is due to the coupling between tides and resonances with the other satellites of the Jovian system. We develop dynamical models that we use to investigate the orbital history of the moons of our solar system.\nLong-term evolution of planets\u2019 obliquity. The planets of our solar system are characterized by very different inclinations of their spin axis (or obliquities). For example, Jupiter has an obliquity of just 3\u00b0, Saturn 27\u00b0, and Uranus even 98\u00b0. We develop dynamical models that we use to explain the current obliquity of the gas giants of the solar system.\nNew formulations of the perturbed two-body problem based on non-singular orbital elements: these are obtained by regularization of the equations of motion or via a purely geometrical approach. Such formulations can substantially improve the accuracy in the propagation of the state and associated uncertainty of Earth\u2019s artificial satellites as well as of natural small bodies in the Solar system.\nPatched dynamics: it is used as a first approximation of more complex models. The solutions of the simpler problem can be used as a starting guess to compute the solutions of the more difficult ones, or sometimes they can be used to obtain the qualitative behavior of the more complex system. We apply patched dynamics to study close approaches of asteroids with the Earth and the passage through shadow for an Earth satellite.\nMembers\nGiulio Ba\u00f9\ngiulio.bau@unipi.it\nClara Grassi\nclara.grassi@dm.unipi.it\nGiovanni Federico Gronchi\ngiovanni.federico.gronchi@unipi.it\nGiacomo Lari\ngiacomo.lari@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nClaudio Bombardelli (Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid)\nclaudio.bombardelli@upm.es\nGiordana Bucchioni (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\ngiordana.bucchioni@ing.unipi.it\nIrene Cavallari (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nirene.cavallari@dm.unipi.it\nJavier Hernando-Ayuso (ISpace)\nj-hernando@ispace-inc.com\nMelaine Saillenfest (IMCCE -- Observatoire de Paris)\nmelaine.saillenfest@obspm.fr\nGiovanni Valsecchi (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, Osservatorio Astrofisico di Torino)\nGiovanni.Valsecchi@iaps.inaf.it\nVariational methods to study periodic orbits of the $N$-body problem\nWe search for new periodic orbits of the Newtonian $N$-body problem as minimizers of the Lagrangian action functional in a set of symmetric loops, imposing also topological constraints. We also search for periodic motions with the same symmetries and topological constraints in the case of non-Newtonian forces, with interaction potentials of the form $1/r^\\alpha$ ($\\alpha>1$), where $r$ is the distance between the two bodies.

These applications have included time series of different origins, biomedical, economic, physical, etc. In particular, it is by now clear that one useful method is the classification of the time series in terms of some notion of entropy and complexity. We collaborate with Centro Piaggio of the University of Pisa to study the complexity of biomedical time series and the effects of noise on their classification.\nMembers\nClaudio Bonanno\nclaudio.bonanno@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nVincenzo Catrambone (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nAndrea Scarciglia (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nGaetano Valenza (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nStatistical properties of dynamical systems\nOur group is interested in the study of the statistical properties of discrete and continuous group actions describing physical phenomena at different scales. We are mostly interested in spectral methods, which have interesting applications in other contexts. The dynamical systems we study are divided into three classes: uniformly hyperbolic systems; non-uniformly hyperbolic and infinite-measure systems; parabolic systems.\nUniformly hyperbolic systems.\nWe are interested in the statistical properties of single and coupled systems. The main properties we study are the existence of rare events and their frequency, and the robustness of the system to small perturbations.\nNon-uniformly hyperbolic and infinite-measure systems.\nIn this case, many of the classical results fail. We are interested in studying the asymptotic behaviour of Birkhoff sums (i.e. the sum of an observable along the orbits of the system), the notion of mixing (i.e. the speed of the loss of memory along the orbits of the system), the analytical properties of the transfer operator and the dynamical zeta function (tools of the so-called thermodynamic formalism approach). In particular, we consider dynamical systems related to regular and multi-dimensional continued fractions algorithms, and to the geodesic and horocycle flows on modular surfaces.\nParabolic systems.\nThese systems are characterised by slow convergence for the Birkhoff sums of the observables along the orbits of the system. The main idea is to accelerate the system or decompose it by looking at observables in suitable anisotropic spaces of functions. By these techniques, one obtains information on the speed of convergence to the equilibrium state and identifies eventual deviations from the typical behaviour or obstructions to it.\nMembers\nClaudio Bonanno\nclaudio.bonanno@unipi.it\nCarlo Carminati\ncarlo.carminati@unipi.it\nStefano Galatolo\nstefano.galatolo@unipi.it\nPaolo Giulietti\npaolo.giulietti@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nMauro Artigiani (Universidad del Rosario)\nmauro.artigiani@urosario.edu.co\nOliver Butterley (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata)\nRoberto Castorrini (SNS, Pisa)\nroberto.castorrini@sns.it\nThomas Garrity (Williams College)\nStefano Isola (Universit\u00e0 di Camerino)\nMarco Lenci (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna)\nDavide Ravotti (Universit\u00e4t Wien)\nTanja Schindler (Universit\u00e4t Wien)\nMatteo Tanzi (King's College London)\nmatteo.tanzi@kcl.ac.uk\nSandro Vaienti (Centre de Physique Th\u00e9orique (CPT))\nvaienti@cpt.univ-mrs.fr\nStochastic dynamical systems and applications\nStochastic Dynamical Systems for Climate Studies.\nWe are interested in applying transfer operator techniques and results obtained in the case of abstract dynamical systems to certain climate models. Once a model flow has been constructed, it is possible to construct operators close in spirit to the transfer operator associated to the time-one map of the flow. The statistical properties of such a system can then be investigated through the functional analytic properties of the operator. We are particularly interested in three aspects of such a study. First, when we interpret the response of the system to the perturbations, we investigate how the invariant measure changes, i.e., the so-called \u201clinear response\u201d of the system (or its absence). Second, we compare our abstract asymptotic results with the existence of appropriate time scales, we do so by scouting for metastable observables, i.e., for example, the system might not be in equilibrium but might stay very close to a periodic cycle for a very long time. Last, we study the appearance and distribution of extreme climatic events. This can be done by exploring recurrence properties to special sets of the phase space on which chosen observables are above/below certain thresholds, which encode the extreme event.\nThermodynamic Formalism, Stochastic Filter and Stochastic Billiards.\nWe study the ergodic properties of stochastic dynamical systems generated by transformations with hyperbolic behaviour on average through the analysis of the spectrum of the transfer operator (thermodynamic formalism). This approach has interesting applications to the problem of the stability of the stochastic filter in probability theory. The problem consists in obtaining an optimal estimate of the state of the system starting from a sequence of observations affected by noise and showing that such an estimate loses memory of its initial condition. We are also interested in the study of stochastic billiards that are obtained from a deterministic billiard by replacing the law of specular reflection with a stochastic reflection law. An orbit of a stochastic billiard table is a Markov chain with transition probability depending on the geometry of the billiard table and the law of reflection. The goal is to show the existence of stationary measures for a large family of billiards with stochastic reflection. Of particular interest is the comparison between the statistical properties of a stochastic billiard and those of the corresponding deterministic billiard.\nMembers\nGianluigi Del Magno\ngianluigi.delmagno@unipi.it\nStefano Galatolo\nstefano.galatolo@unipi.it\nPaolo Giulietti\npaolo.giulietti@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nJochen Broecker (University of Reading)\nJo\u00e3o Lopes Dias (ISEG - Universidade de Lisboa)\njldias@iseg.ulisboa.pt\nJos\u00e9 Pedro Romana Gaiv\u00e3o (ISEG - Universidade de Lisboa)\njpgaivao@iseg.ulisboa.pt\nSandro Vaienti (Centre de Physique Th\u00e9orique (CPT))\nvaienti@cpt.univ-mrs.fr\nDynamical systems with singularities and billiards\nHyperbolic Systems with Singularities.\nA hyperbolic dynamical system is characterized by the presence of expanding and contracting directions. This property produces a complex behavior that in many ways appears stochastic despite the deterministic nature of the system. We are interested in hyperbolic dynamical systems with piecewise regular dynamics (systems with singularities). They represent natural models for mechanical systems with collisions such as billiards. The main aim of the project is the study of the ergodic properties of hyperbolic systems with singularities. In particular, we want to study the existence and properties of special invariant measures called SRB that describe the statistical properties of most of the system\u2019s orbits. We are also interested in the construction of hyperbolic billiards and the analysis of their ergodic properties. Conditions on the geometry of the billiard table and on the law of reflection that guarantee the hyperbolicity of billiard tables in the plane are well known. The goal is to weaken these conditions and extend them to billiards in Euclidean spaces of any dimension.\nGeneric Properties of Convex Billiards.\nWe investigate generic properties of billiards in convex regions of any size with a regular border (Birkhoff billiards). A property of particular interest is the positivity of the topological entropy which guarantees the existence of a non-trivial hyperbolic set (Smale\u2019s horseshoe). The genericity of this property is known for Birkhoff billiards in the plane. The extension of this result to Birkhoff billiards in arbitrary dimensions is the main objective of this project.\nMembers\nGianluigi Del Magno\ngianluigi.delmagno@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nMario Bessa

Since the discovery of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and with the classification of topological insulators, the role of geometry and topology in condensed matter physics has been rapidly promoted to a fundamental paradigm, and it is nowadays a booming area of research. Mathematical physics, in particular the mathematical methods developed to treat quantum mechanics, provides the natural framework for the analysis of these phenomena. While we have a clear understanding of topological phases of matter in the 1-body approximation, the challenge for the near future is the comprehension of the interplay between topological effects and interactions among quantum particles. In typical condensed matter systems, the number of particles involved is huge, thus requiring the formulation of effective theories which describe their behavior in terms of fewer degrees of freedom. One of the most renowned examples is the cold Bose gas and its condensation, deeply related to the emergence of superfluidity and superconductivity in fermionic systems. From the point of view of mathematics, it appears that the techniques and effective theories used to describe many-body quantum systems will also play a crucial role in the analysis of topological phases. A clear mathematical description of these physical systems will in the long term also help in the development of new technologies, for example in quantum computation or solid-state memory devices.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

While our final goals are highly ambitious, and hence very risky, all the intermediate achievements of our project are of great interest in themselves. Therefore, any partial success in this research program would constitute a significant advance of the state of the art. In addition, as we detail shortly, many tasks are interconnected, so any advance in one will facilitate advances in the others.\nMore precisely, we intend to better study the spectral theory of transfer operators on functional spaces whose topology encodes the geometric properties of the system.\nThis task (TO) is subdivided into six subtasks:\n\nTO1) the study of the dynamical zeta function;\n\nTO2) the study of refined limit laws, with small errors, for observable of hyperbolic dynamical systems;\n\nTO3) the study of partially hyperbolic systems;\n\nTO4) the study of renormalizable parabolic systems;\n\nTO6) the study of mean-field systems and the derivation of Vlasov-like dynamics in billiard systems.\n\nThe next goal is the study of extended (non-compact) systems or systems with respect to a sigma-finite measure.\nThis task (NC) is subdivided into five subtasks:\n\nNC1) the study of Birkhoff sums;\n\nNC2) the study of infinite mixing;\n\nNC3) the study of horocycle flow and multi-dimensional continued fractions;\n\nNC4) the study of thermodynamic formalism for infinite-measure-preserving intermittent maps;\n\nNC5) the study of the Lorentz gas, especially the aperiodic case.\n\nFinally, we would like to investigate symplectic systems with both regular and chaotic behavior. Indeed, the case in which a system displays both regular (KAM island) and chaotic (positive metric entropy) behaviour is believed to be typical.\nThis task (MP) is subdivided into three subtasks:\n\nMP1) the study of homoclinic hyperbolic orbits (and hence positive topological entropy) in billiards;\n\nMP2) the study of systems with some randomness, e.g., billiards with random reflection law, to address the problem of the size of the Lyapunov exponents and mixing;\n\nMP3) the study of the precise speed of the convergence to equilibrium of a standard map with very small randomness.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

New physical principles and materials are urgently needed to improve the energy efficiency, information density and the data processing speed in the future devices to continue the trends of Moore's scaling law in the coming 20 year period. Spintronics, a branch of microelectronics that aims to harness the spin of the electron for information storage and processing is an emerging discipline that offers potentially unprecedented improvements in energy efficiency for data storage and processing. It also holds a great promise for novel hardware implementations of neuromorphic, probabilistic and reservoir computing, going beyond the classical von Neumann architecture and suitable for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence systems. Developing spintronic applications requires a thorough theoretical understanding of the behavior of complex magnetic systems.\nThese are described by systems of nonlinear and nonlocal partial differential equations subject to topological constraints. Our team combines a diverse applied mathematics expertise in modeling, analysis and simulation of energy-driven phenomena in a variety of physical systems and is ideally suited to carry out an interdisciplinary study of the coherent magnetization structures of strong interest to spintronics. Specifically, we will focus our efforts on the three types of magnetization configurations currently pursued experimentally in ultrathin ferromagnetic nanostructures: magnetic skyrmions, skyrmionic bubbles and domain walls. Skyrmions are the magnetization configurations that are endowed with non-trivial topological characteristics that make them robust against thermal noise and therefore offer an exciting possibility of their use to encode bits of information. In this project, we will carry out a comprehensive analysis of existence, stability, creation and manipulation of magnetic skyrmions under realistic conditions encountered in device-driven applications. It will require developing the analytically and numerically tractable mathematical models that will properly account for the effect of confinement in the device geometries and describe the highly non-trivial interactions of skyrmions there. This will involve an extensive use of the tools of the calculus of variations and PDE analysis, together with the use of existing and in-house software. The obtained mathematical results will be validated in close collaboration with our international experimental physicist partners.\nThe potential impact of the results of the proposed research on the computer industry and society in general is high. An important component of the proposed research is the involvement of a new generation of applied mathematicians into this highly interdisciplinary area of research.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

In recent years it has become clear that the increasing population of space debris could lead to catastrophic consequences in the near term.\n\nThe Kessler syndrome (where the density of objects in orbit is high enough that collisions could set off a cascade) is more realistic than when it was first proposed in 1978. Although statistically less likely to occur, an asteroid impact would have devastating consequences for our planet.\n\nAlthough an impact with a large (~10 km) to medium (~300 m) sized, or diameter, asteroid is unlikely, still it is not negligible as the recent case of the asteroid Apophis has demonstrated. Furthermore impacts with smaller size objects, between 10 m to 100 m diameter, are expected to occur more frequently and hence are, proportionally, equally dangerous for humans and assets on Earth and in space.\n\nStardust is a unique training and research network devoted to develop and master techniques for asteroid and space debris monitoring, removal/deflection and exploitation.\n\n-Stardust will train the next generation of engineers, scientists and decision makers to protect our planet, save our space assets, and turn the threat represented by asteroids and space debris in an opportunity.\n-Stardust will push the boundaries of space research with innovative ideas and visionary concepts.\n-Stardust will integrate multiple disciplines, from robotics, to applied mathematics, from computational intelligence to astrodynamics, to find practical and effective solutions to the asteroid and space debris issue.\n\nThe scientific program focuses on a number of underpinning areas of research and development that are fundamental to any future and present initiative aiming at mitigating the threat posed by asteroids and space debris, and is divided into three major research areas: Modelling and Simulation, Orbit and Attitude Estimation and Prediction, and Active Removal/Deflection of Non-cooperative Targets.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

Quantum walks are the quantum counterpart of random walks on a graph and, like classical random walks, they can be defined in a continuous-time or in a discrete-time framework. Continuous-time quantum walks evolve according to the Schroedinger equation on a suitable Hilbert space. For discrete-time quantum walks, on the other hand, several different definitions of the evolution operator are available, in most cases according to the coined or the Szegedy formalisms. Both continuous-time and discrete-time quantum walks have been proved to be universal for quantum computation.\nQuantum walks are often used for algorithm design. In particular, thanks to their favorable diffusion properties, they are often employed in the context of unstructured search problems, resulting in a quadratic speedup with respect to classical approaches. Further applications include the formulation of quantum centrality and communicability measures in network analysis.\nResearch activity in this field focuses on the study of hitting time for various kinds of discrete-time quantum walks on directed graphs, and on the applications of continuous- and discrete-time quantum walks in network analysis.\nQuantum Block Encoding (QBE), instead, is a fundamental ingredient in quantum numerical linear algebra. Its importance is motivated by the fact that quantum evolution is necessarily unitary: in particular, all matrices need to be represented in unitary form, for instance as a suitable quantum circuit. Roughly speaking, a block-encoding of a matrix $M$ is a unitary matrix $U$ that contains $M/\\alpha$ as its top left block, where $\\alpha\\geq\\|M\\|_2$ is a scaling factor. Clearly, the presence of structure in $M$ facilitates the development of effective block-encoding strategies, which are crucial to ensure significant speedup in quantum algorithms \u2014 for instance, solving an $N\\times N$ linear system with runtime polylogarithmic in $N$.\nMembers\nPaola Boito\npaola.boito@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nGianna M. Del Corso (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nHigh Performance Computing\nResearch in numerical linear algebra for high-performance computing focuses on developing efficient algorithms and techniques for solving large-scale linear algebra problems that arise in various computational tasks, such as solution of partial differential equations, data analysis, optimization, and machine learning.\nThis field addresses challenges related to the scalability, accuracy, and performance of numerical methods when dealing with massive datasets or complex mathematical models. We investigate algorithms that can exploit the parallelism and vectorization capabilities of modern high-performance computing architectures, such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators like FPGAs or TPUs. A particular emphasis is given to open-source software development and the construction and implementation of innovative algorithms into the PSCToolkit suite of libraries (\nhttps://psctoolkit.github.io/\n), and into the development of preconditioners to improve the convergence rate and stability of iterative methods for solving large sparse linear systems, particularly important for solving systems arising from partial differential equations.\nMembers\nFabio Durastante\nfabio.durastante@unipi.it\nLuca Heltai\nluca.heltai@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nPasqua D'Ambra (IAC -- CNR (Napoli))\nSalvatore Filippone (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata)\nsalvatore.filippone@uniroma2.it\nMarkov Chains and Complex Networks\nMany problems from the applications are modeled by\nMarkov chains\n. Very often the set of the states is huge or even infinite. In these cases customary techniques are not suited to solve this kind of problems.\nThe goal of this research area is the design and analysis of effective solution algorithms for\ninfinite Markov chains\n, with special attention to the ones coming from\nqueuing models\n. This goal is reached by developing theoretical tools relying on on\ncomplex analysis\n, numerical analysis, and\nstructured matrix computations\n.\nA close connection exists between Markov chains and\ncomplex networks\n, which are graphs with particular structures. On these graphs, it is of great interest in applications to define centrality measures, that rank the nodes by importance. The computation of such measures can be challenging for large networks, and techniques based on iterative methods for functions of matrices and large-scale linear systems can be adopted in this context.\nMembers\nDario Andrea Bini\nbini@dm.unipi.it\nStefano Massei\nstefano.massei@unipi.it\nBeatrice Meini\nbeatrice.meini@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nPaola Favati (CNR - Pisa)\nChuan H.

For instance, the celebrated\nalgebraic Riccati equation\nwhich in the continuous time models takes the form $XBX+AX+XD+C=0$, is related with the analysis of\nstability of dynamical systems\n. Here, $A,B,C,D$ are given matrices of compatible sizes and $X$ is the unknown matrix. Quadratic equations like $AX^2+BX+C=0$ model\ndamped vibration problems\nas well as\nstochastic models\nencountered in the analysis of queues. In the case of\nqueues of the M/G/1 type\nthe equations take the form $\\sum_{i=-1}^{\\infty} A_{i}X^{i+1}=0$ where a matrix analytic function over a suitable domain is involved.\nThe goal of the research in this area is to develop tools for designing fast and effective algorithms to solve this kind of equations. These equations, as well as similar ones, can be recast as\ngeneralized eigenvalue problems\n; for instance, the latter is related to finding $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}$ and $x\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ such that $(\\lambda^2 P +\\lambda Q + R)x=0$ (quadratic eigenvalue problem). The techniques needed combine the ones used for general nonlinear equations (multivariate\nNewton methods\n, fixed-point iterations) and\neigenvalue problems\n(Schur decompositions, orthogonal reductions, rational approximations).\nMatrix structures\n(such as\nentrywise nonnegativity\n,\nsymmetry\nand\nsymplecticity\n) play a crucial role in all of this; they are needed for defining the solutions of these equations in the first place, and to ensure feasibility, accuracy and computational efficiency of the numerical algorithms.\nApplications of these equations include\ncontrol and system theory\n, queuing theory and structured\nMarkov chain\nmodelling in applied probability, and\ntime series\nestimaton in statistics. It is useful to\ninterface directly\nwith researchers working in these application fields: the different points of view provide useful insight, and the algorithms can be better tailored to the needs of the practitioners.\nIn several applications, different sets of measurements produce different\nsymmetric positive-definite matrices\nas a result; a natural problem is finding the most plausible correct value for the desired matrix. This corresponds to a form of averaging. The plain\narithmetic mean\n$\\frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n)$ is not always the best choice from this point of view.\nThe concept of\ngeometric mean\nof a set of positive number can be extended to the case of a set of positive definite matrices. However, this extension is not so trivial and, while for the case of two matrices there is a unique definition, in the case of several matrices there exist an infinite number of valid definitions.\nThe most general setting under which to study this problem is the one of\nRiemannian geometry\n: one gives a Riemannian scalar product on the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and studies the point which\nminimizes the sum of squared distances\nfrom the given matrices (Cartan mean). This gives rise to a mean which is compatible in some sense with matrix inversions, much like the\ngeometric mean\nin the scalar case.\nIn addition to the theoretical aspects,\npractical computation\nof these means is an interesting problem, a special case of\noptimization on manifolds\n. The classical multivariate methods from optimization need to be adapted to work on a generic manifold; one needs to consider the role of its\ntangent space\nand construct suitable maps to and from it.\nThis kind of mean is of great importance in the applications, especially in engineering and in problems of\nradar detection\n.\nOur goal is to provide a better understanding of the different concepts involved in this research,\nnew definitions\nof mean which are better suited for the applicative models, faster and more\nreliable algorithms\nfor their computation.\nMembers\nDario Andrea Bini\nbini@dm.unipi.it\nFabio Durastante\nfabio.durastante@unipi.it\nStefano Massei\nstefano.massei@unipi.it\nBeatrice Meini\nbeatrice.meini@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nChun-Hua Guo (University of Regina)\nSophie Hautphenne (University of Melbourne)\nBruno Iannazzo (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Perugia)\nGuy Latouche (Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles)\nVolker Mehrmann (Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin)\nGiang Nguyen (The University of Adelaide)\nFederico Giovanni Poloni (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nfederico.poloni@unipi.it\nVaidyanathan Ramaswami (AT&T Labs)\nTimo Reis (Universit\u00e4t Hamburg)\nGiacomo Sbrana (NEOMA Business School)\nNonlinear eigenvalue problems and polynomial rootfinding\nGiven a matrix-valued function $F(z)$, the eigenvalues are the points in the complex plane where $F(z)$ has a non-trivial kernel, or its rank drops. Computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (the vectors in the kernel) for general nonlinear function is challenging, and can often by achieved by appropriate matrix iterations, or by linearizing the problem and solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.\nThe latter strategy is particularly appealing when $F(z)$ is either a matrix or a scalar polynomial. For this specific case, particularly structured version of the QR iteration have been developed. For the scalar case, the group has developed a software package capable of computing roots of high-degree polynomial with arbitrary accuracy (\nMPSolve\n).\nThis area is closely related with structured matrices, in particular semiseparable and rank-structured one.\nMembers\nDario Andrea Bini\nbini@dm.unipi.it\nPaola Boito\npaola.boito@unipi.it\nLeonardo Robol\nleonardo.robol@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nGiuseppe Fiorentino (Accademia Navale di Livorno)\ngiuseppe.fiorentino@unipi.it\nLuca Gemignani (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nFederico Giovanni Poloni (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nfederico.poloni@unipi.it\nLow-Rank Approximation and Structured Matrices\nThis research area deal with the problem of efficiently finding low-rank factorization of matrices $A$, in the form\n$$A \\approx UV^T,$$\nwhere $U,V$ are tall and skinny matrices. In most cases of interest one assumes to either be able to evaluate $X \\mapsto AX$ and $Y \\mapsto A^TY$ or to sample selected entries of $A$ at a reduced cost. Several strategies may be adopted for retrieving matrices $U,V$, such as\nrandomized linear algebra\nmethods, or\ncross-approximation\ntechniques.\nA natural evolution of this idea is to consider\nstructured matrices\n, which are \u2013 in general \u2013 not low-rank, but may have low-rank blocks, or obtained as low-rank perturbations of particularly structured matrices. The aim is to represent such matrices using $\\mathcal O(n)$ or even $\\mathcal O(1)$ storage and perform operations with a similar complexity (up to logarithmic factors in the dimension).\nIn particular, the following structures are considered:\nRank-structured matrices\n: Matrices with off-diagonal blocks of low-rank (\nHODLR\n), which may be efficiently representable using hierarchically structured bases (\nHSS\n).\nLow-rank perturbations of Toeplitz matrices\n: matrices with this structure form an algebra, which has important applications in the study of queues and Markov chains. See also the section on the numerical solution of Markov chains below. Matrices in this class can often be represented with a storage that is independent of the dimensions, enabling the numerical study of infinite and semi-infinite matrices.\nFor matrices in this form, efficient arithmetic operations are available.

To this aim, structure-preserving or geometric numerical methods seek to achieve physically consistent numerical solutions by preserving the geometric and topological structure of the governing mathematical model.

To counteract ill-posedness additional a priori information is given by assuming that the studied phenomena can be well described by certain physical models. These models can come in the form of ordinary or partial differential equations or they can be given by a prior probability distribution. The first hypothesis is associated with deterministic reconstruction algorithms (e.g. PBDW), while the second hypothesis is the starting point of Bayesian inversion where the data are used to compute a posterior distribution that represents the uncertainty in the solution. In both research directions, we are interested in the development of efficient filtering algorithms and in the study of related aspects, such as accuracy quantification, computational efficiency of the sampling strategies, dynamical approximation of the state, adaptation of the measurements via sensors\u2019 update, observation noise, modeling errors, etc.\nMembers\nCecilia Pagliantini\ncecilia.pagliantini@unipi.it\nCollaborators\nMartin Grepl (RTWH Aachen University)\nOlga Mula (Eindhoven University of Technology)\nKaren Veroy-Grepl (Eindhoven University of Technology)\nFederico Vismara (Eindhoven University of Technology)\nFractional Differential Equations\nResearch on numerical methods for Fractional Partial Differential Equations (FPDEs) is an emerging and rapidly growing field at the intersection of fractional calculus and computational mathematics.

Such problems are ubiquitous in modern Data Science and permeate different fields such as uncertainty quantification and dynamical systems monitoring, image and signal processing, finance, network science, and computational chemistry, to name a few. The overarching theme of the project is the development of dimensionality reduction techniques based on the identification and exploitation of (approximate) low rank structure in the data. Techniques for computing\nlow-rank approximations of matrices and tensors are currently receiving considerable attention and can lead to the efficient solution of problems previously considered intractable due to the curse of dimensionality.\nMany problems in network science and in applied probability require the solution of large linear systems, the solution of eigenvalue problems, and the approximation of functions of large matrices. Often the matrices involved have (approximate or perturbed) rank and/or tensor (Kronecker) structure. Techniques for solving such problems, including new preconditioning techniques and specialized rational Krylov subspace methods, will be developed. We will also tackle the important problem of efficiently updating centrality measures and other network quantities after the network undergoes a low-rank change, such as addition, deletion or rewiring of a few links.\nIn another direction, low-rank formulations are needed to approximate the solution of challenging partial differential equations such as in space-time or parameter-dependent problems. There, suitable linear algebra should be considered that adheres to the design of tensor discrete spaces, thus preserving structural properties typical of the continuous solution. Part of the proposal concerns the development of algorithms for solving multiterm matrix and tensor linear equations stemming from problems of this type.\nThe results of the research project will impact several application areas including network analysis, parameter-dependent numerical modeling and applied probability (Markovian modeling). Attention will be paid to both theoretical and computational aspects including the implementation of effective algorithms, software design and dissemination.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

Classical numerical approaches require - at the very least - large computational power, excellent meshing tools, and the fulfillment of hypotheses which are often too stringent for real-life applications.\nA particularly relevant example of problems that are severely limited by available computational technologies are biphasic systems with embedded interfaces such as vascularized biological tissues or fiber-reinforced materials. These systems are characterized by the intrinsic dimension of the immersed phase (for example, the blood vasculature) that is orders of magnitude smaller than the system scale, so that resolving the full geometrical complexity becomes unfeasible. Computational and mathematical tools can be used to analyze the functioning of these systems and to establish quantitative relationships between phenomena occurring on larger and smaller scales, leading to insights that could not be obtained otherwise. This modeling standpoint, bridging larger and smaller scale phenomena, is called the mesoscale. In this context, our reference applications are blood flow, transport phenomena and mechanics in complex vascular networks, such as the ones perfusing the brain. As a result, this project may significantly impact society by promoting the in-silico investigation of cancer and age-related neurological disorders.\n\nFrom the mathematical standpoint, this research project focuses on the development and analysis of non-matching and immersed computational methods combined with complexity reduction methods, to enable the mesoscale resolution of problems with embedded structures. This objective entails the formulation, analysis, and approximation of Mixed-Dimensional PDEs (MD-PDEs), more precisely, coupled PDEs defined on embedded domains of different dimensionality, including the case of high-dimensionality gap. The immersed finite element method and the coupling through Lagrange multipliers are numerical techniques at the forefront of research in the context of numerical approximation of PDEs, which look ideally suited to tackle these problems. This project will hinge around these techniques to build a comprehensive approximation platform for MD-PDEs. The application of this platform to realistic and biologically relevant problems involving complex vascular networks embedded into permeable and deformable biological tissues will also be provided in the form of reproducible benchmarks.\nThe research units in Milano, Trieste and Trento share a consolidated expertise on advanced discretization schemes based on variational approaches, such as finite elements, immersed methods, and model order reduction combined with a vivid activity on the modeling of blood flow problems and its applications to various areas of medicine, with primary interests to cardiology, oncology and neurology.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

We aim at reducing the complexity of the problem in the spirit of Reduced Order Methods (ROMs). ROMs rely on projecting the Full Order Models (FOMs) onto smaller subspaces. An expensive offline preprocessing phase is followed by a fast online phase capable of delivering a solution in real-time.\nThe analysis of ROMs for eigenvalue problems is still at a preliminary stage and the available results show the potential and the difficulties of different approaches. Following our exploratory GRG2020 grant, we will develop new techniques and apply them to solid mechanics.\nWe start from linear elasticity and the challenges associated with problems in mixed form and with the imposition of the symmetry of the stress at discrete level.\nWe then move to nonlinear solid mechanics where we consider the vibration of hyperelastic structures. The challenges related to this problem start from the FOM and from the deep understanding of the nonlinear stress-strain relationship. We plan to investigate these aspects in detail and to explore the use of ROM for reducing the costs of the numerical simulations.\nFurther critical challenges come from the study of heterogeneous materials. The heterogeneities can be modeled either as a parametric eigenvalue problem\nwith deterministic parameters of with stochastic parameters. It is crucial in this case to be able to model correctly multiscale data beyond periodicity and scale separation.\nAnother possible approach for modeling the heterogeneities consists in immersed methods which can be used in presence of biphasic systems with embedded interfaces such as vascularized or biological tissues or fiber reinforced materials. These problems are characterized by some of the intrinsic dimensions of the immersed phase that is orders of magnitude smaller than the system scale, making the resolution of the full geometrical complexity unfeasible.\nThe final phase of the project will be devoted to the study of metameterials. Our investigations will deal with challenges related to the well-posedness of the problem, depending on the parameters describing the materials.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

STEAM education is gaining prominence over the last decade and is being included in school curricula of several countries because it promotes critical thinking and creativity amongst other competences that are necessary to face a fast-changing world. In this regard, several projects are being implemented all around the world in order for students to achieve improvements in performance and to develop positive attitudes towards STEAM. However, most existing materials and activities focus mainly on one or two of the separate STEAM disciplines without considering the potential for delivering STEAM curriculum through an integrated approach. In addition, many disseminated proposals have been developed by specialists and researchers form higher education and need to be adapted to be implemented by professionals in the field who are the teachers in schools. Moreover, most activities were implemented at local or national levels, but these are not always adequate for being used in different cultural realities. For this reason, there is a need to develop STEAM educational materials designed to be implemented by primary school teachers in their classes at an international level.\n\n##### Objectives\nWith the aim of increasing the levels of achievements and interest in STEAM in primary school, the ProSTEAM project intends to develop educational packages related to STEAM (including contents, science kits and guidelines of implementation) to be implemented at an international level. At total of 10 educational packages will be produced, 5 for 1st and 2nd grades (6 to 8 years old) and another 5 for 3rd and 4th grades (8 to 10 years old). In this regard, experts on STEAM education (higher education teachers and researchers) will collaborate with primary school teachers in order to produce rigorous scientific materials in line with primary school curricula. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) will be one of the themes of the educational packages. A total of nine partners will participate in this project including four universities, a polytechnic institute, and 4 schools from four countries (Italy, Lithuania, Portugal and Serbia). In order to accomplish the activities, regular face-to-face meetings will be held to develop the network and promote knowledge and skills amongst partners, including five transnational meetings for planning and monitoring and one LTT (Learning, Teaching, Training Activities). In addition, five Multiplier events are planned to be organized in all the countries participating in this project as a way to disseminate and sustain the project in the long run.\n\n##### Activities\nA general framework and a pedagogical plan will be produced to guide and support the ProSTEAM teams in the development of STEAM educational packages to be implemented at an international level. To ensure that the produced educational packages will promote students\u2019 intrinsic motivation and achievement in the STEAM subjects and that they may be implemented with efficacy by primary school teachers of different countries, a validation study will be carried out at different levels. A first level will include the evaluation of the educational content and materials, a second level is related to teachers\u2019 usability perception about the educational packages, in order that we can get an overview of the efficacy of implementation by primary school teachers. The third level of validation will focus both on students\u2019 achievements on the specific topic related to STEAM and on their affective reactions (including emotions associated to the activities and motivational factors). At levels two and three we will follow a \u201cresearch-based design\u201d approach revising the educational packages according to the results obtained in each of the two cycles of evaluation. Data analysis will also be used to enrich the guidelines for teachers with the aim of providing examples of what can be expected from the use of the materials and support to its effectiveness. To validate the educational packages an evaluation protocol will be developed. Moreover, the validation process will enable us to highlight the potentialities of the educational packages, as well shedding light on new uses for them. We expect that these outputs will contribute to validating and also helping to produce effective good practices that may be adopted by several schools in Europe. Detailed accounts of both the process of design and that of validation will provide a solid foundation for other similar projects related to STEAM. In this regard, these outputs may be used by anyone interested in validating STEAM educational material at an international level, namely by other countries interested in developing this kind of project. Finally, dissemination and exploration of the results and outputs of ProSTEAM amongst the international community will be provided to increase the partnership in the future and promote the sustainability of the project. Moreover, the proposal of a teachers\u2019 professional development programme to continue after the ProSTEAM project ends will also contribute to dissemination and sustainability of ProSTEAM.\n\n##### Impact\nWe expect to promote a collaborative workforce with the team members of the project in order to develop a solid partnership and network valuable to the successfully implementation of the project and to its sustainability. In this regard, we intend to identify, develop, share, implement and validate STEAM hands-on practices amongst the partners of the project. As a result, we expect to produce at least 10 educational packages that may be implemented with efficacy by primary school teachers of different countries with the targeted public, who are primary school students aged 6 to 10 years old. Moreover, we expect that the educational packages will promote students\u2019 interest and skills in the STEAM subjects and also promote their awareness about the SDG. Additionally, a teacher\u2019s guide and student\u2019s handbook will be available compiling all teaching and learning STEAM resources.\n\nAnother important expected outcome is related with the example of ProSTEAM for developing a strategic partnership with primary schools. In fact, it is not usual or easy for primary schools to conduct this type of projects. For this reason, a partnership with higher education institutions is a way of giving the first steps to involve primary schools in international projects that will benefit their students and teachers. We expect that after this experience more primary schools will follow the example of their peers and this starts to be a common practice amongst primary schools. In this regard, we intend to produce guidelines to inspire and help others to join this kind of projects. Finally, we expect that the experience in the ProSTEAM project will make schools active in promoting collaboration with other schools sharing what they have developed in terms of knowledge and skills and this will become a common practice. Finally, we expect, through the ProSTEAM online community of practice (OCoP) to spread the project achievements and outcomes as far as possible to disseminate the educational materials and increase our partnership in the future with more countries in order to promote the sustainability of the project.\n\u00a9 2024\nResearch\nBack to top"}

The study plan is created using the\nCAPS interface\n, which is accessible with the personal academic credentials (the same ones used for the Alice portal). The plan will then be evaluated by the Study Plans Committee. The study plan can be submitted multiple times during the course of studies, but submissions can only occur within these three time windows within the academic year:\n1 September \u2013 30 November;\n1 February \u2013 31 March\n;\n1 June \u2013 30 June.\nThe study plan submitted outside of these periods will remain pending and will be evaluated in the next available time window.

Similarly, if you wish to change your curriculum, simply submit a new study plan with the updated curriculum. Changes to the study plan and curriculum are immediately effective once the plan is approved. However, new plans must be proposed well in advance of the graduation date.\nThe last submitted and approved study plan is considered valid.\nATTENTION: it is important to choose the option corresponding to your Academic Year of enrolment.\nFor information about previous academic years or for further details, please refer to the corresponding Master\u2019s Course Handbook at the\nfollowing page\n.\nEnrolled from the Academic Year 2021/22\nFundamental\nComputational\nYear 1\nMathematical analysis 1 (15 CFU/ECTS)\nArithmetic (9 CFU/ECTS)\nPhysics I with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nFundaments of programming with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nGeometry 1 (15 CFU/ECTS)\nIntroductory Computational Mathematics Lab (6 CFU/ECTS)\nYear 2\nAlgebra 1 (6 CFU/ECTS)\nMathematical analysis 2 (12 CFU/ECTS)\nNumerical analysis with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nElements of probability and statistics (6 CFU/ECTS)\nGeometry 2 (12 CFU/ECTS)\nScientific English (6 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nAlgorithms and data structure (6 CFU/ECTS)\nYear 3\nRational Mechanics (6 CFU/ECTS)\nPhysics II (9 CFU/ECTS)\nScientific Computing (6 CFU/ECTS)\nPhysics III (6 CFU/ECTS)\nComputational laboratory (6 CFU/ECTS)\nExperimental laboratory of computational mathematics (6 CFU/ECTS)\nProgramming languages with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nOne exam from the\nMCMA group\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nOperational research (6 CFU/ECTS)\nOne exam from the\nMCTF group\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFinal Exam\n(9 CFU/ECTS)\nEnrolled from the Academic Year 2015/16 to 2020/21\nFundamental\nComputational\nYear 1\nMathematical analysis 1 (15 CFU/ECTS)\nArithmetic (9 CFU/ECTS)\nPhysics I with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nFundaments of programming with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nGeometry 1 (15 CFU/ECTS)\nLaboratory of Communication through computer (3 CFU/ECTS)\nYear 2\nAlgebra 1 (6 CFU/ECTS)\nMathematical analysis 2 (12 CFU/ECTS)\nNumerical analysis with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nElements of probability and statistics (6 CFU/ECTS)\nGeometry 2 (12 CFU/ECTS)\nScientific English (6 CFU/ECTS)\nDidactics Laboratory of computational mathematics (3 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nAlgorithms and data structure (6 CFU/ECTS)\nYear 3\nRational Mechanics (6 CFU/ECTS) (*)\nPhysics II (9 CFU/ECTS)\nScientific Computing (6 CFU/ECTS)\nPhysics III (6 CFU/ECTS)\nComputational laboratory (6 CFU/ECTS)\nExperimental laboratory of computational mathematics (6 CFU/ECTS)\nProgramming languages with laboratory (9 CFU/ECTS)\nOne exam from the\nMCMA group\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nOperational research (6 CFU/ECTS)\nOne exam from the\nMCTF group\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFree-choice course\n(6 CFU/ECTS)\nFinal Exam\n(9 CFU/ECTS)\n(*) \u201cDynamical systems\u201d for those enrolled up to Academic Year 2016/17 (included)\nNotes\nStudents must choose which exams they intend to pass when submitting their study plan.

The difference between the two is significant: the entrance exam is used to select students to Courses with limited enrolment, while the evaluation test helps incoming students to assess their initial level of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evaluation test for students wishing to enrol is organized by\nCon.Scienze\nand made by the\nCISIA\nconsortium. In particular, candidates are required to answer 60 questions chosen among the\nTOLC-S\nversion or the\nTOLC@HOME\n(type TOLC-S)\n:\n20 questions on\nMatematica di base\n(Basic Maths);\n10 questions on\nRagionamento e Problemi\n(Reasoning and Problems);\n30 questions on\nInglese\n(English).\nThe test is passed if the candidate obtains:\nat least\n15 points\nin the modules\nMatematica di Base\nand\nRagionamento e Problemi\ncombined;\nat least\n15 points\nin the module\nInglese\n.\nThe Course handbook specifies that\nstudents must take the test either before the beginning of lectures or within three months after it\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible to see an example test on the\nCISIA webpage\n. To get an idea of the basic mathematical topics that are useful to know in order to pass the evaluation test and, in general, to enrol for the Degree Courses in Mathematics, you can check the\nfollowing web page\n(link to page in Italian): it contains videos and slides of several preparatory courses held some time ago (but still relevant!) by Prof. Massimo Gobbino.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents who do not take or pass the test can still enrol in the Bachelor\u2019s Degree Course in Mathematics, but they will have an Additional Learning Obligation (Obbligo Formativo Aggiuntivo, OFA). The obligation is considered fulfilled according to the rules found on the\ndedicated page\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the above, it is\nvery important\nfor a student wishing to enrol to take the evaluation test. In particular, an analysis based on data from past academic years reveals that it is highly probable students will encounter serious difficulties during their first months if their score in\nMatematica di Base\nand\nRagionamento e Problemi\ncombined is a little lower than 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional info, in particular regarding when and where to take the test and the procedures to enrol, can be found on the\nCISIA webpage\nor by contacting the\nAcademic Services Office\nof the Department of Mathematics.\n\u00a9 2024\nEducation\nBack to top"}

Further information on each can be found in the\nResearch section\n.\nYou can consult the\nacademic rules\nand\nregulations\nof the Ph.D. Programme in the section below.\nAcademic rules and regulations of the Ph.D. Programme\nPh.D. Programme Departmental Regulations (\nItalian\n|\nEnglish\n)\nPh.D. Programme University Regulations\n(in Italian only)\nFurthermore, the presence of Ph.D. representatives on the Board of the Ph.D. Programme and the Department Council is regulated by the\nUniversity Statute\n(see in particular article 25, paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 \u2013 in Italian only) and the\nGeneral Regulations of the University of Pisa\n(see in particular from article\u00a073 to 81 \u2013 in Italian only).\nThe Programme lasts\n3 years\nand combines\nstudy\nand\nresearch\n. During the Programme, students are required to complete\n6 courses\n(more details on this can be found below). Within the first year of enrolment, together with the Board of the Ph.D. school, students choose a\nresearch project\nto be carried out under the supervision of one or more members of the Department of Mathematics. The Coordinator, taken the Board\u2019s advice, will assign a\nsupervisor\nand a\nco-supervisor\nto each student before the end of their first year.\nThe main objective of the Ph.D. study is\nthe definition and development of a scientific research line in mathematics\n, aimed at the achievement of\noriginal results\n, which are then argued in the Ph.D. thesis. All students are encouraged to spend\na period of study and research abroad\nduring their 3 years in the Programme, for up to a maximum of 12 months.\nAdmitted students will enjoy the\nvibrant scientific and academic life\nof the department. They will be given\ncomplete access to the departmental facilities\n(library, computers, etc.) and a\npersonal desk\nin a shared office. They will also have access to an\ninternal Wiki platform for Ph.D. students\n, which currently includes a section that contains all pertinent information for\nincoming students\n, as well as a section dedicated to assisting those who are nearing the completion of their Ph.D. programme in their\nsearch for postdoctoral positions\n.\nScholarship\nEach admitted student is given a\nscholarship\n, which includes a\nsalary for 3 years\n. The monthly net salary funded by the University is currently around\n\u20ac1.129,27\n. The salary can be increased by up to 50% for a maximum of 12 months of research abroad. Furthermore, each year a\nresearch grant\nis given to each fellow, amounting to at least 10% of the scholarship.\nMore info can be found at the following\nlink\n.\nAdmission\nThe number of students admitted to the Programme varies every year, and it is usually between 4 and 6.\nEligible candidates must hold a\nMaster\u2019s Degree\n, or be forecasted to obtain one within a given deadline, typically before the beginning of the academic year.\nThe application period may vary from year to year and is usually in the\nsummer\n, lasting for about 30 days. Interested students should keep an eye on the Admission page of the Doctoral Schools of the University of Pisa. Applications must be submitted through a centralized online procedure.\nThe admission procedure consists of\ntwo main steps\n. In the first step a designated examining Commission selects candidates, supported by reference letters, based on their\nacademic qualifications and research potential\n. Those who pass the first step are then interviewed. The interview will focus on the\nresearch interest\nof the candidates, the\nprojects\npursued during their academic careers (e.g. master\u2019s degree theses) and the\ntopics\ntherein. Winning applicants must enrol following the deadlines and procedures communicated together with the final ranking.\nFurther information can be found\nhere\n(in English),\nhere\nand\nhere\n(both in Italian).\nCompulsory Courses\nDuring the Programme, Ph.D. students are required to attend\n6 courses\n(at least 2 during the first year) and\npass the exam of 2\nof them, of which at least 1 during the first year and both before 31st January of the third year. The courses can be chosen from the ones offered by the Ph.D. programme (click\nhere\nfor the course offer of the current academic year and\nhere\nfor previous years\u2019), or by other qualified institutions, after agreement with the coordinator of the Programme.\nFinal Examination\nAt the end of the 3 years, students must\nwrite\nand\ndefend\na\nPh.D. thesis\n. The thesis will be evaluated by\ntwo external referees\n, who may suggest revisions. After revision, the thesis will be defended in front of an examination committee appointed by the board of the Ph.D. Programme. Typically, the defence takes place within between 3 to 6 months from the end of the third year. Ph.D. theses shall be written in English or Italian, or in another language subject to the Board\u2019s approval.\nCotutelle Programmes\nThe current incoming and outgoing joint agreements (\u201ccotutelles\u201d) are listed below.\nIncoming\nViola Giovannini\nfrom the University of Luxembourg (Luxembourg)\nKenta Tomioka\nfrom Waseda University (Japan)\nKusaba Ryunosuke\nfrom Waseda University (Japan)\nOutgoing\nDaniele Barbera\nwith Waseda University (Japan)\nMario Rastelli\nwith Waseda University (Japan)\n\u00a9 2024\nPh.D.\nBack to top"}

The study of links is a central topic in low-dimensional topology. An important tool to study knots and links is given by link homology theories. Khovanov introduced one of these theories in the early 2000s. A few years later, together with Rozansky, Khovanov defined a family of homology theories called Khovanov-Rozansky homologies.\nThe aim of these lectures is to provide an introduction to Khovanov-Rozansky homologies covering the basic definitions, important properties, several variants, and some applications. We chose to focus mostly on topological applications and, in particular, applications to the study of concordance.\nThe plan is to quickly cover some basic material on knot theory, and then start with Khovanov homology. We will introduce the $s$-invariant and see the main applications of this theory. Then, we will turn to the definition of the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies. We focus on two different definitions: the original via matrix factorizations and the definition via foams. Afterwards, an idea of how to prove functoriality for Khovanov-Rozansky homologies is given. We conclude with an overview of the applications of these theories and open problems.\nTime permitting, in the final part of the course, we will cover some additional topics which may depend on the students\u2019 interests.\nPrerequisites:\nLinear algebra, basic group theory (basic definitions: groups, subgroups, quotients, etc.), commutative algebra (ring, modules, tensor product, etc.), homological algebra (chain complexes, homotopy equivalence, short and long exact sequences, etc.). No prior knowledge about knot theory is required as we shall cover the basic facts needed.\nWebsite of the course:\nPlease, visit\nhere\n.\nDal problema di ricerca all\u2019analisi dei dati: esperienze di ricerca qualitativa in didattica della matematica\nLecturers:\nGiulia Lisarelli\ngiulia.lisarelli@unipi.it\nAnna Ethelwyn Baccaglini-Frank\nanna.baccaglinifrank@unipi.it\nPeriod:\nNovember 2024 \u2013 February 2025 (30 hours)\nDescription:\nDurante il corso verranno presentate alcune esperienze di ricerca qualitativa in didattica della matematica delle docenti, che metteranno in luce i processi seguiti, a partire da un problema, per arrivare all\u2019impostazione metodologica della ricerca, all\u2019analisi dei dati e ai risultati.

The first one is devoted to recalling\u00a0some (easy)\u00a0properties of convex sets and introducing some (not-so-easy)\u00a0representations, such as the support function and the gauge function. In the second part, we will move on\u00a0to the description of the space of\u00a0convex bodies, namely the family of nonempty compact convex sets of $\\mathbb R^n$, endowed with a suitable notion of distance. Among other topics, we will cover\u00a0the Blaschke-selection theorem and the\u00a0Brunn-Minkowski theorem.\nWe will conclude, in the third part, with some applications in shape optimization, with a numerical analysis flavor.\nThere are no prerequisites to attend the course.\nSome references:\nbook:\u00a0\u201cBodies of Constant Width, An Introduction to Convex Geometry with Applications\u201d, by Martini, Montejano, Oliveros\nbook:\u00a0\u201cConvex bodies: the Brunn-Minkowski theory\u201d, by Schneider\nbook:\u00a0\u201cShape Variation and Optimization\u201d, by Henrot and Pierre\narticle:\u00a0\u201cNumerical shape optimization among convex sets\u201d, Bogosel,\u00a0Appl Math Optim\u00a087, 1 (2023).\nAn introduction to micro- and nanomagnetics\nLecturer:\nCyrill Muratov\ncyrill.muratov@unipi.it\nPeriod:\nSecond term (30 hours)\nDescription:\nMicromagnetics is a continuum modeling framework introduced in the 1930s by Landau and Lifshitz to describe the statics, dynamics and stochastics of the atomic spins in ferromagnetic materials. It has been demonstrated time and again to be successful in describing a great variety of magnetic phenomena in all sorts of ferromagnetic materials and devices. Nevertheless, with the advent of magnetic nanomaterials since the early 2000s new physical effects that give rise to additional intriguing physical phenomena need to be incorporated into consideration. This course is aimed at reviewing the state of the art of micromagnetic modeling and analysis, with the discussion of the emergent new challenges in the context of magnetic nanomaterials. The course will cover (to the extent that time permits):\nthe origin of ferromagnetism, the classical micromagnetic energy functional and the basic magnetization structures in ferromagnets\ndifferent representations of the stray field and magnetic domains\none-dimensional domain walls and their stability\nflux closure domains, interior and boundary vortices\ndimension reduction: dots, wires and films\nantisymmetric exchange in non-centrosymmetric materials\ntopological spin texture\nAn introduction to stochastic PDEs\nLecturer:\nMarco Romito\nmarco.romito@unipi.it\nPeriod:\nSecond term (30 hours)\nDescription:\nStochastic PDEs are infinite dimensional problems that incorporate random influences and noise as much as stochastic differential equations incorporate random influences and noise in finite dimensional systems described by differential equations. Stochastic PDEs find applications in physics, finance, biology, and in general any model with spatially extended randomness.\nThe course aims to be a thorough mathematical introduction to the topic, starting from the basic tools (such as Gaussian measures in infinite dimension and semigroup theory) and the basic models (linear and semi-linear stochastic equations), and concluding with a selection of some of the most recent developments in the theory.\nPreliminaries:\nThe requirements for the course are basic concepts in probability theory and stochastic analysis, basic notions of functional analysis, mainly properties of Hilbert and Banach spaces, and basic knowledge of PDEs. A prior knowledge of SDEs is helpful, but non-mandatory. Any other necessary piece of knowledge will be discussed during the course.\nDerived categories and applications to the theory of Hall algebras\nLecturer:\nFrancesco Sala\nfrancesco.sala@unipi.it\nPeriod:\nApril \u2013 June 2025\nDescription:\nThe derived category of a variety stands as one of the most refined invariants which encode its geometry. Furthermore, it serves as a prime example of triangulated categories, often regarded as \u201cnoncommutative\u201d varieties. This course aims to provide an overview of the theory of triangulated categories and their properties, such as t-structures. The second part of the course delves into the application of this theory to explore an algebraic structure in geometric representation theory known as \u201cHall algebras.\u201d\nPrerequisites:\nProspective students would benefit from familiarity with the theory of abelian categories and some prior knowledge of basic algebraic geometry (e.g. varieties).\nElements of Geometric Analysis in finite and infinite dimensions\nLecturer:\nValentino Magnani\nvalentino.magnani@unipi.it\nPeriod:\nSecond term (30 hours)\nDescription:\nIn the first part of the course, we provide an overview of various results and problems arising from different synthetic formulations of Geometric Analysis. We start by introducing general tools from Analysis in Metric spaces, especially in relation to geodesics, Sobolev spaces, and differentiation of measures. Then we describe the main differences between the \u201ccommutative\u2019\u2019 Geometric Analysis of Euclidean spaces and the \u201cnoncommutative\u2019\u2019 Geometric Analysis of the so-called homogeneous Lie groups. A special attention will be devoted to the problem of computing the intrinsic area of submanifolds in a noncommutative homogeneous group, pointing out some recent open questions.\nIn the second part of the course, we mainly study some classes of infinite dimensional Lie groups. We introduce weak and strong Riemannian metrics, the Levi-Civita covariant derivative, the concept of curvature and geodesic distances in infinite dimensions. We also present some counterexamples and problems that only appear in infinite dimensions. An astonishing phenomenon is the vanishing of the geodesic distance, which P. Michor and D. Mumford conjectured to be related to the blow-up of the sectional curvature. Finally, some rigidity results concerning biLipschitz embeddings of homogeneous groups into Banach spaces will be discussed in relation to general versions of Rademacher\u2019s differentiation theorem.\nPrerequisites:\nBasic facts about Banach spaces and basic notions of Differential Geometry, Measure Theory, and Multilinear Algebra.\nErgodic theory of geodesic flows\nLecturer:\nClaudio Bonanno\nclaudio.bonanno@unipi.it\nPeriod:\nMarch \u2013 June 2025 (30 hours)\nDescription:\nThe course will be an introduction to the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow on Riemannian negatively curved surfaces, a classical example of a hyperbolic flow which is a flourishing research area in dynamical systems.\nThe statistical distribution of the orbits of the geodesic flow was already studied in the first half of the last century, first for the case of surfaces with constant negative curvature and then in the general case of variable curvature, and it was established the existence of a very rich dynamics making the geodesic flow\u00a0as a prototypical example of a chaotic system. However, it was not until 1998 that the first quantitative result appeared about the speed of the decay of correlations for the case of compact surfaces with variable curvature, a result lately sharpened by applying the modern techniques of the dynamical systems theory.\nAfter recalling the classical results, the course will focus on the more recent results about the decay of correlations,\u00a0discussing the case of surfaces with constant negative curvature\u00a0in full detail\u00a0and the extensions of the results to\u00a0manifolds of higher dimensions.\nFinally, we will introduce the thermodynamic formalism approach to dynamical systems and apply it to count the number of prime closed geodesics.\nTime permitting, we will discuss some recent results on the ergodic properties of the horocycle flow, an example of parabolic flow, which depends on the geodesic flow.\nPrerequisites\n:\nIt requires just a basic knowledge of differential geometry, dynamical systems, and functional analysis. The advanced notions of dynamical systems will be recalled in the course.\nHarmonic maps and applications\nLecturers:\nBozhidar Velichkov\nbozhidar.velichkov@unipi.it\nGiulia Bevilacqua\ngiulia.bevilacqua@dm.unipi.it\nCarlo Gasparetto\ncarlo.gasparetto@dm.unipi.it\nPeriod:\nFrom March 2025 to May 2025 (30 hours)\nDescription:\nThis course will be an introduction to the study of Harmonic maps and to their applications to the theory of Minimal surfaces and Free-boundary problems. In the first part of the course, we will introduce the notion of Harmonic map and discuss existence theorems. Then, in the second part, we will focus on regularity properties, showing the Epsilon-regularity result by Schoen and Uhlenbeck. Finally, we discuss some applications to minimal surfaces and free-boundary problems.\nPrerequisites:\nKnowledge and use of Sobolev Spaces.\nReferences\n:\nM. Giaquinta, L.

This PhD course focuses on developing high-performance computational methods for solving real-world PDEs.\nThe course will explore the following key areas:\nFinite Element Method (FEM): We will quickly review the theoretical foundation of FEM, a powerful technique for discretizing PDEs into a system of algebraic equations\ndeal.II Library: The course will leverage the capabilities of deal.II, a high-performance finite element library, for efficient implementation of FEM discretizations.\nDomain Decomposition Methods: We will explore strategies for parallelizing FEM computations by decomposing the computational domain into subdomains, enabling efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources.\nParallel Linear Algebra Techniques: Techniques for solving large-scale linear systems arising from FEM discretizations on parallel architectures will be a key focus. This includes exploring libraries like PETSc or Trilinos, in conjunction with deal.II.\nMatrix-Free Geometric Multigrid Methods: We will investigate matrix-free geometric multigrid methods, which are powerful iterative solvers that exploit the geometric structure of the problem to achieve optimal scaling properties, with negligible storage requirements.\nBy combining these elements, the course equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop and implement high-performance solutions for complex PDEs on modern computing platforms. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming exercises and case studies, enabling them to tackle real-world scientific and engineering challenges.\nPrerequisites:\nThis course assumes a strong foundation in applied mathematics, including numerical analysis, linear algebra, and partial differential equations.

It is one of the most important geometric evolution problems with many facets of studies such as analysis of singularities, notions of weak solution, solvability of initial value problems, and so forth, and the course touches upon some of the recent developments.\nThe course consists of two parts. The first part is on the MCF in the framework of Geometric Measure Theory called the Brakke flow. Starting from the definitions and preliminaries, many of the basic properties of Brakke flow as well as some advanced topics such as the general existence theory will be covered.\nThe second part focuses on classical results on MCF obtained with a PDE approach. The main topics are short-time existence, the maximum principle, evolution equations of geometric quantities, and the analysis of type I and II singularities in the special case of positive mean curvature. In particular, the case of planar curves will be analyzed in full detail.\nSome familiarity with measure theory and parabolic equations is desirable but not necessary.\nReferences:\n*Tonegewa, Yoshihiro, Brakke\u2019s Mean Curvature Flow: An Introduction, Springer Briefs in Mathematics, Springer, 2019\n*Mantegazza, Carlo, Lecture notes on mean curvature flow, Progress in Mathematics,\nBirkh\u00e4user/Springer Basel AG, Basel, 2011.\n*Mantegazza, Carlo, Novaga, Matteo and Pluda, Alessandra, Lectures on curvature flow of networks,\nIn \u201cContemporary research in Elliptic PDEs and Related Topics\u201d, Springer INDAM series, vol. 33, 2019.\nWinter/Spring Term\nAn introduction to Khovanov homology and its applications\nLecturer:\nLukas Lewark (Universit\u00e4t Regensburg)\nSchedule:\nFebruary 27, 11 am -13 pm, February 28, 11 am -13 pm, March 1, 11 am -13 pm, March 3, 9-11 am \u2013 all lectures in Sala Riunioni\nDuration:\n8 hours\nAbstract:\nthe Jones polynomial introduced in 1984 was the first so-called quantum invariant in knot theory. It associates to every knot a polynomial, which is not defined in a geometric but rather in a diagrammatic way.\nFifteen years later, Khovanov homology was introduced as a so-called categorification of the Jones polynomial. In spite of its combinatoric origins, Khovanov homology has an ever-growing number of geometric applications in knot theory. In this mini-course, we will first work through the detailed construction of Khovanov homology, following a modern version of Bar-Natan\u2019s tangle setup. Then, we will see some of the applications, such as Rasmussen\u2019s proof of the Milnor conjecture (regarding the unknotting number of torus knots). Previous knowledge of knot theory and homological algebra is helpful, but will not be required.\nBreaking Nonconvexity: Consensus-Based Optimization\nLecturer:\nMassimo Fornasier\nDescription:\nHigh-dimensional global optimization of nonconvex/nonsmooth functions can be a formidable mathematical and numerical problem with a vast number of possible applications, not least in machine learning. Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is a multi-particle metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method that can globally minimize nonconvex nonsmooth functions and is amenable to theoretical analysis.\u00a0 In fact, optimizing agents (particles) move on the optimization domain driven by a drift towards an instantaneous consensus point, which is computed as a convex combination of particle locations, weighted by the cost function according to Laplace\u2019s principle, and it represents an approximation to a global minimizer. The dynamics are further perturbed by a random vector field to favor exploration, whose variance is a function of the distance of the particles to the consensus point. In particular, as soon as the consensus is reached the stochastic component vanishes. As the dynamics of the algorithm can be described as an Euler-Maruyama approximation scheme of a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE), the first part of the course is about a concise primer on stochastic calculus and stochastic differential equations. We also need to introduce the concept of mean-field limit, to show how the law of the system of SDE converges in a suitable (weak) sense for the large particle limit to the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) of Fokker-Planck-type. The combination of the analysis of the large-time behavior of the solution of the PDE with the mean-field limit will then be the key strategy to prove the global convergence of the algorithm.\nThe results unveil the internal mechanisms of CBO that are responsible for the success of the method. In particular, the convergence proof will show that essentially CBO performs a convexification of a very large class of optimization problems as the number of optimizing agents goes to infinity. We further present formulations of CBO over compact hypersurfaces and the proof of convergence to global minimizers for nonconvex nonsmooth optimizations on the hypersphere. We further mention further variations of CBO to include anisotropic noise and impulsive noise exploration, to approximate other methods such as particle swarm optimization, and numerical tricks and implementations. We conclude the course with several numerical experiments, which show that CBO scales well with the dimension and is extremely versatile. To quantify the performances of such a novel approach, we show that CBO is able to perform essentially as good as ad hoc state-of-the-art methods using higher-order information in challenging problems in signal processing and machine learning, namely the phase retrieval problem, the robust subspace detection, and training of neural networks.\n\u2013 Gradient descent for smooth and convex functions\n\u2013 Stochastic gradient descent\n\u2013 Simulated annealing\n\u2013 Gradient descent for non-smooth and non-convex functions\n\u2013 A primer on stochastic calculus and stochastic differential equations\n\u2013 From particle swarm optimization to consensus-based optimization (CBO)\n\u2013 Well-posedness of (CBO) and its mean-field limit\n\u2013 Large-time behavior and proof of global convergence\n\u2013 Variations on the theme: anisotropic noise, gradients, memory, and CBO over compact hypersurfaces\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15130\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12184\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11994\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11988\nCombinatorics of the flag variety\nLecturer:\nPhilippe Nadeau (Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1)\nSchedule:\nThe Course will start on April, 4 (Aula Seminari)\nDuration:\n18 hours\nIn this course, I will present various combinatorial aspects of the complex Grassmannian (briefly) and flag variety (in more detail). We will first recall the classical path going from intersection problems in these varieties to algebraic and combinatorial techniques. In the Grassmannian case, integer partitions and symmetric polynomials (in particular Schur polynomials) play a fundamental role. In the case of the complete flag variety, the combinatorics is that of permutations and Schubert polynomials, which form a basis of multivariate polynomials. We will present these objects in detail, leading to current research questions about them.\nInterdisciplinary Celestial Mechanics\nLecturer:\nGiovanni Federico Gronchi (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nSchedule:\nThe Course will start on March, 2 (Sala Riunioni)\nDuration:\n30 hours\nDescription:\nIn this course, I\u2019ll describe some results concerning the applications of techniques of calculus of variations or computational algebra to classical problems of celestial mechanics, like searching for periodic orbits of the N-body problem or computing an orbit of a solar system body using observations made from optical telescopes.\nPreliminary program:\nPreliminaries of celestial mechanics\nthe N-body problem;\ncollisions and regularization: methods by Levi-Civita and Kustaanheimo-Stiefel;\nnon-collision singularities, Von Zeipel\u2019s theorem.\nPeriodic orbits with variational methods\ndifferent methods to search for periodic orbits;\nthe \u201cfigure eight\u201d by Chenciner and Montgomery;\norbits with symmetry and topological constraints;\nexamples of Gamma-convergence in celestial mechanics.\nAlgebraic problems in orbit determination (OD)\nclassical methods in OD: methods by Laplace and Gauss;\nmultiple solutions in preliminary OD;\nthe Keplerian integrals method;\nGroebner\u2019s bases in OD problems.\nL-functions\nLecturer:\nDavide Lombardo (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nSchedule:\nThe course will be held from March 2023\nDuration:\n30 hours\nDescription:\nThe course aims to introduce the notion of an L-function, a tool at the boundary between algebraic and analytic number theory, and to prove some classical results in arithmetic using this language. It will consist of approximately 30 hours of lectures and aims to also be accessible to motivated master\u2019s students. The lectures will include a review of the prerequisite notions from number theory.\nPreliminary program:\nClassical L-functions: Riemann\u2019s zeta function, Dirichlet\u2019s L-functions, analytic continuation and functional equation.

Many groups of interest in geometry and topology, most notably mapping class groups, are however not hyperbolic, and it is therefore natural to try to generalise the notion of the hyperbolic group to encompass as many of these examples as possible. The notion of hierarchical hyperbolicity, inspired by the deep work of Masur and Minsky, achieves just that. Roughly speaking, a hierarchically hyperbolic structure on a metric space or group is a coordinate system where the coordinates take values in hyperbolic spaces. I will give an introduction to hierarchically hyperbolic spaces, thereby describing the (coarse) geometry of mapping class groups, and explain what this kind of structure is good for and how to show that a given space or group is hierarchically hyperbolic.\nMonotonicity formulas in free boundary and geometric variational problems\nLecturers:\nBozhidar Velichkov (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa), Roberto Ognibene (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa), Giorgio Tortone (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nSchedule:\nThe Course will start on February, 27 (n. 2 lessons per week)\nDuration:\n30 hours\nSyllabus:\nThe course is an introduction to the regularity theory for free boundary problems and geometric variational problems.\u00a0The focus is on the role of the monotonicity formulas in the analysis of the structure of nodal sets, free boundaries, and free discontinuities.\u00a0In particular, on the analysis of the singularities.\nThe course will be divided into four main parts:\nPart 1. Regularity theory for the one-phase Bernoulli problem\n(approx. 15 hours, Bozhidar Velichkov). We will provide a complete analysis of the free boundary for the one-phase problem. We will prove the optimal (Lipschitz) regularity of the solutions, and we will introduce the notions of blow-up sequences and blow-up limits, for which a key tool will be the Weiss monotonicity formula. We will show how to decompose the free boundary into a \u201cregular set\u201d and a \u201csingular set\u201d and we will prove that the \u201cregular set\u201d is a smooth manifold via an epsilon-regularity theorem. We will then introduce Federer\u2019s dimension reduction principle in order to estimate the dimension of the \u201csingular set\u201d. We will then discuss the application of the same strategy in the case of minimal surfaces.\nPart 2. Almgren frequency function and unique continuation\n(approx. 5 hours, Roberto Ognibene). The aim is to discuss Almgren\u2019s frequency function for solutions to elliptic PDEs and to show how it can be used to study the structure of their nodal sets. We will show for instance how to deduce the unique continuation property (which in its classical form is the fact that the nodal set has an empty interior) for certain classes of PDEs.\nPart 3. Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman\u2019s monotonicity formulas\n(approx. 5 hours, Giorgio Tortone). We will discuss the celebrated Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula and its application to the regularity of the solutions of the two-phase Bernoulli problem, as well as its applications to the optimal partition problem and to the regularity of the solutions of elliptic PDEs.\nPart 4. Harmonic maps\n(approx. 5 hours, Luca Spolaor).\u00a0 This part will consist of several (2-3)\u00a0introductory lectures on the theory of harmonic maps.\nMonotonicity formulas in nonlinear potential theory and their geometric applications\nLecturers:\nLuca Benatti (Universit\u00e0 di Pisa)\nDuration:\n17 April 2023 \u2013 22 May 2023\n\u00a9 2024\nPh.D.\nBack to top"}

The course provides an introduction to classical and recent results concerning the long-time behavior of some classes of Markov processes. In the first part, we will introduce some tools typical of potential theory in an elementary context, with a focus on the reversibility non-reversibility paradigm. In the second part of the class, we will focus on establishing recent results for more involved models and infinite-dimensional dynamics.\nSyllabus:\nErgodicity and long-time behavior of Markov processes.\nPotential theory and spectral analysis for processes on graphs.\nApplications to statistical mechanics models.\nA cohomological version of the non-abelian Hodge correspondence\nLecturer:\nMark De Cataldo (Stony Brook University \u2013 New York, USA)\nSchedule:\nMay 30, June 1, June 3, and June 6, from 10 am to 12 am\nDescription:\nLet $X$ be a compact Riemann surface, that is a smooth projective complex algebraic curve. The non-abelian Hodge correspondence establishes a relation between the moduli space of $n$-dimensional representations of the fundamental group of $X$, the moduli space of pairs $(E, D)$, where $E$ is a rank $n$ holomorphic vector bundle and $D$ is a flat holomorphic connection on $E$, and the moduli space of Higgs bundles, i.e., the pairs $(E, \\Phi)$, where $E$ is a rank $n$ holomorphic vector bundle on $X$ and $\\Phi\\colon E\\to E\\otimes T^\\ast X$ is a morphism of holomorphic vector bundles. By imposing suitable stability conditions or irreducible conditions, one can endow these spaces with the structure of algebraic varieties. The non-abelian Hodge correspondence states that these moduli spaces are diffeomorphic. On the other hand, these moduli spaces are not isomorphic as algebraic varieties. The $P=W$ conjecture states that a filtration in cohomology, which arises naturally when one considers the moduli of Higgs bundles, corresponds to the weight filtration of the mixed Hodge structure of the moduli space of representations of the fundamental group.\nDe Cataldo\u2019s course will introduce the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles (and the Hitchin fibration), the moduli space of flat connections, the $P=W$ conjecture, first over the complex field and later over an arbitrary field, explaining how to readapt the notions and the results in the latter case.\nSyllabus:\nModuli spaces of Higgs bundles and the Hitchin morphism\nModuli spaces of flat connection and the Hitchin $p$-morphism in positive characteristic\nA cohomological version of the non-abelian Hodge theorem in positive characteristic\nA consequence of $P=W$ for the complex field via finite fields\nBibliography:\nde Cataldo-Zhang\nde Cataldo-Maulik-Shen-Zhang\nMutually enhancing connections between Ergodic Theory, Combinatorics, and Number Theory\nLecturer:\nVitaly Bergelson (Ohio State University, USA)\nTimetable:\nThe course will last 14 hours (4 lessons of 3h 30min each from 02:30 p.m. to 06:00 p.m.): the first lesson will take place in Aula G (Polo Fibonacci) on May 30, the second and third one (May 31 and June 1) will take place in Aula Magna (Department of Mathematics), and the last one in Aula E1 (Polo Fibonacci) on June 3.
