Some of those data scientists have even \u201chypothesized\u201d that they will not need our scientific theories and knowledge to solve physical problems any more. My task in this presentation is to hopefully convince you that training neural networks, which relies on a mix of statistics and inverse theory, can benefit from our geo/physical laws and a priori knowledge to guide us through the maze of degrees of freedom the neural networks may offer, and specifically to alleviate the many weaknesses/gaps/biases in data. This can be accomplished by instilling our physical laws and their corresponding characteristics into the neural network.\nEni Shares Insight on Making Carbon Capture Goals a Reality.

CCS is the only immediately available option for reducing emissions in the so-called hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, steel, chemical and paper mills, etc. Geology and Geophysics (G&G) play a key role in the whole chain of storage site selection, characterization and monitoring. The lecture introduces the basic concepts of CO2 storage and shows how G&G disciplines contribute to the success of an industrial CCS projects.\nShort Biography\nDavide Della Moretta is the Head of the Basin Geology Department at Eni Headquarters, Milan.

Etgen\n(British Petroleum)\nfrom Houston,\nwill come to Pisa to deliver the lecture\n\"\nPractical insights and techniques in seismic velocity estimation\n\"\n.\nStudents and researchers are invited on\nFriday\n, the\n11\nth of\nOctober\n, hrs.\n14\n:\n0\n0\np\nm, Room\nC\nof the DST.\nThe event is organized by the Student Chapter of the University of Pisa and is supported by the Master of Science in Exploration and Applied Geophysics.\nParticipating to the event will contribute to obtain ECTS for the \"Other Activities\".\nSummary\nThe estimation of seismic wave speeds plays one of the most important and critical roles in seismic data processing. As we explore more complex and previously unexplorable provinces, as well as demanding ever-higher quality images from seismic reflection data everywhere, accurate velocity models are of paramount importance. I feel this topic is so important that everyone involved in creating images from seismic reflection data should understand the fundamentals of seismic velocity estimation and be able to recognize limitations and pitfalls in practical applications. This lecture is designed to provide insights into how seismic velocity estimation really works, what you can resolve, and what you will have difficulty resolving. I will present experiments that demonstrate the power and limitations of tomographic approaches that rely on iterative prestack migration. During this discussion you will learn concepts that might at first seem counter-intuitive; for example, lateral resolution of velocity anomalies can often be higher than vertical resolution. I will demonstrate simple and effective ways of performing analysis and quality control during velocity model construction. Finally, we will discuss emerging and advanced methods for building velocity models in the most complex settings that are currently of industrial interest.\nBiography\nJohn T. Etgen received a bachelor of science degree in geophysical engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in 1985 and a Ph.D.\nin geophysics from Stanford University in 1990. During his studies, he had the good fortune to work on a wide variety of topics in seismic imaging and data processing while learning from his mentors, Jon Claerbout and Norm Bleistein, along with many talented colleagues and fellow students. His thesis studied new-at-the-time prestack migration-driven tomographic techniques for velocity estimation. That experience taught him the true difficulties of inverse problems. Leaving Stanford behind, he began his industrial career in late 1990 at the Amoco Production Research Company in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Unlike many new Ph.D. graduates, he did not want to continue to work on his thesis topic! Fortunately, once again he had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of topics and learn from leading researchers, such as Dan Whitmore, Rusty Alford, Kurt Marfurt, Ken Kelley, Sam Gray, and many others. In 1999, Amoco merged with British Petroleum (BP) and John moved to Houston, Texas. His role was senior scientist and then senior scientific advisor for seismic imaging at BP. In 2008, he and Carl Regone were awarded the Virgil Kauffman medal for their work in wide-azimuth marine seismic. In late 2011, John was appointed distinguished advisor for seismic imaging at BP. John currently serves as assistant editor for the scientific journal Geophysics and continues to work in the upstream technology organization at BP.\nADMISSION TESTS FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2019-2020\nDates of\nAdmission Tests for Academic Year 2019-2020\n:\nSeptember 05, 10:00 AM\nSeptember 12, 10:00 AM\nSeptember 19, 10:00 AM\nThe tests will be held at the 3rd floor of the Department of Earth Sciences, via S.

The satellites cruising around the earth help our daily communication. The spacecrafts travel interplanetary space to collect information. Radio telescopes watch birth and death of stars. We try to understand what happened in the galaxies millions of light years away. Yet we cannot see what is behind the wall next to us or what is under our feet. Geophysics is a tool to \u201csee\u201d the invisible. Any physical phenomenon provides hints to geophysics: vibration, sound, mass, electric and magnetic properties, heat, radiation, and cosmic rays as much as our imagination could lead us. With a clear understanding of the phenomenon, we can predict what is in the invisible space. With appropriate instrumentation, we can prove it. With the wildest imagination, we can develop ways to \u201csee the invisible.\u201d Geophysicists study the natural phenomena to understand the system. Some geophysicists design instruments right for observing the phenomena and some geophysicists interpret the data to \u201csee\u201d the invisible. Geophysics is a fun subject. It offers you a lot of challenge and a lot of reward. This presentation guides you around the fascinating world of geophysics.\nShort biography\n: Koya Suto received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in exploration geophysics from Mining College, Akita University, and studied further at the University of Adelaide. Born in Japan, Suto first studied gravity, airborne magnetics, and radiometrics for geologic mapping and mineral exploration. He worked for the petroleum industry as a seismic geophysicist for 25 years. Koya started Terra Australis Geophysica in 2003 to service the civil engineering and environmental industries with near-surface geophysical surveys using the surface wave seismic (MASW) method. Since then, he has presented a number of case histories of MASW surveys in international conferences. He served as a Federal Executive of the Australian Society of Exploration Geophysicists (ASEG) for more than 20 years including as president in 2013\u201314. Through his involvement in ASEG and its international associates, he was awarded a Service Certificate from ASEG and Recognition of Merit from the Society of Exploration Geophysicists of Japan. Koya also was awarded an Honorary Membership of ASEG in 2010, an Honorary Membership of the Association of Geoscientists and Environmentalists of Serbia in 2015, and the Harold Mooney Award from the SEG Near Surface Technical Section in 2015.

On a global scale, clean water for human consumption and crop irrigation ranks amongst the greatest societal challenges. Water management requires addressing the challenges of (amongst others) developing reliable and cost-efficient methods for mapping water resources and for predicting the spatio-temporal dynamics of hydrogeochemical processes. These challenges are exacerbated by the changing climate that will result in, among other things, increases in drought periods and sudden floods. Hydrogeophysics and hydrology are the key methods for addressing these challenges thanks to their ability to map and monitor the subsurface and to measure, model and predict groundwater flow.\nMore...\nShort Biography\nGianluca Fiandaca is Associate Professor in Hydrogeophysics at the Department of Geoscience of the Aarhus University (Denmark). He has key expertise in electric and electromagnetic methods and integration with hydrological data for improved mapping of groundwater resources, development of geophysical processing and inversion algorithms and geophysical characterization of contaminated sites, landfills and leachate plumes.\nMore...\nOnly for the students of the Master Course in Exploration and Applied Geophysics, participating to the lecture will contribute to obtain cfu for the \"Other Activities\".\nLecture     \"Discrete element method for modeling wave propagation in dry and saturated granular media\"\nPhD Hongyang Cheng\nfrom the University of Twente (NL) delivers the lecture\n\"Discrete element method for modeling wave propagation in dry and saturated granular media\"\n. The students and researchers are invited on Tuesday, the 11th of September, at 10:30 am, room F of the DST.\nAbstract\nThe Discrete Element Method (DEM) captures the collective behavior of a granular material by tracking the kinematics of the constituent grains. DEM simulations using measured particle configurations as input, e.g., from X-ray imaging, allows for a micromechanical interpretation on the acoustic response of a given granular system. This talk covers the fundamentals of DEM and the applications to wave propagation in dry and saturated granular media. For the calibration of DEM models, we use an iterative Bayesian filtering approach to infer\u00a0the posterior probability distribution of grain properties, conditioned to experimental data. Once calibrated, time and frequency domain techniques can be applied to investigate the acoustic properties such as dispersion relations. The numerical modeling of wave propagation in saturated granular media requires a coupling of hydrodynamics with particle motion. The coupling scheme is briefly presented and its powerful capability shown in the comparison with Biot's analytical solution of wave velocities in saturated granular-elastic media.\nShort biography\nDr. Cheng is a postdoc in the Multi-Scale Mechanics group of Prof. Stefan Luding at the University of Twente (UT). Before joining the UT, he worked on multiscale characterization of\nstructured/nonstructured fibre-soil mixtures at Hiroshima University, Japan.\nDuring his PhD, he initiated an independent research line on\nBayesian uncertainty quantification\nin discrete element method (DEM) simulations of granular media. He developed a Bayesian calibration toolbox\nGrainLearning\nfor the open-source DEM package YADE, which allows the inference of grain properties from macroscopic measurements. Within the Bayesian framework,\nhis research now focuses on wave propagation in dry and saturated granular media, using coupled numerical methods (DEM/FEM/LBM).\nOnly for the students of the Master Course in Exploration and Applied Geophysics, participating to the lecture will contribute to obtain cfu for the \"Other Activities\".\nPGS will be visiting Pisa University\nPGS will be visiting the Earth Science Department of Pisa University.\nThe visit of the\nPetroleum Geo-Services Company\n(\nwww.pgs.com\n) will be divided into two days.\n31st May:\n- 9am - 11am: Company presentation (Room C)\n- 11am - 12am: Refreshment\n- 14pm - 18pm: Interviews (Meeting Room)\n1st June:\n-9am - 12am: Interviews (Meeting Room)\n-13am - 16am: Interviews (Meeting Room)\nThe Interviews are reserved only for the registered students.\nDownload the flier here.\nFor the students of the Master Course In Applied Geophysics: participating to the seminar will contribute to obtain cfu for the \"Altre Attivit\u00e0\".\nCGG are coming to Pisa\nThe\nCGG Company\n(\nwww.cgg.com\n)\nPresentation and Mock Video Interviews Session will\ntake\nplace on\n6th June 2018\nat the Earth Sciences Department of the University of Pisa.

Such skills will make our graduates able to face and solve different types of geophysical, geological, and engineering problems in a broad range of contexts. Our MSc\u00a0is strategically divided into three specialized paths, each offering a unique set of skills highly requested by the job market.\nPath I\nExploration Geophysics\nThis curriculum is tailored to equip ou studends with the skills and knowledge needed to characterize the Earth's subsurface at different scales. Exploration geophysics allow to image the subsurface using different geophysical investigation methods and\u00a0play a central role in the search of conventional and renewable energy sources as well as the monitoring of underground CO2 storage operations.\nPath II\nApplied Geophysics\nWith this curriculum, our students gain hands-on experience in utilizing geophysical methods to solve practical problems in engineering and environmental contexts. Applied geophysicists play a crucial role as key professionals in evaluating subsurface conditions for construction projects, monitoring and conducting non-destructive testing of civil infrastructures, assessing groundwater resources, and engaging in environmental monitoring and remediation, to cite a few examples.\nPath III\nEarthquake and Volcano Physics\nIn this curriculum, our students acquire knowledge of the physical mechanisms governing earthquakes and volcanic processes. A deeper understanding of the Earth's dynamic processes is crucial for implementing more efficient risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This research-oriented curriculum is particularly suited for those aspiring to pursue a career in academia or research centers.\nWhether your passion lies in resource exploration, engineering and environmetal applications, or natural hazard mitigation, our Master program ensures that you will graduate with a comprehensive skill set that will make you successfull in the next step of your career.

Overall, the geophysical market is extremely large and includes many industrial sectors such as energy and georesources exploration, environmental protection and restoration, civil engineering, and cultural heritage.\nEnergy and Georesources\nThe energy sector is certainly the main player in the geophysical market. Here geophysics is extensively used for the exploration of conventional and renewable energy resources (e.g. geothermal resources) but also for the induced seismicity monitoring associated with underground industrial operations (e.g. Geothermal Enrgy Production and CO2 storage operations). Thanks to the strict connection of the MSc in Exploration and Applied Geophysics with companies operating in this sector, many of our graduates got a job at ENI (the major energy company in Italy) or in geophysical companies such as Schlumberger, CGG, PGS, and many others.\nEnvironmental and Civil Engineering\nAlthough smaller but not less important, the environmental and civil engineering sector, mainly represented by small-to-medium size companies, holds a good fraction of the geophysical market. Here geophysics is used to assist the design of large infrastructures (tunnels, highways, bridges) but also for detecting and tracking pollutants (just to make a few examples). Also in this case many alumni of our MSc program currently work in such companies or founded their own companies and startups.\nScientific Research\nGeophysics plays a pivotal role in diverse research areas, including exploring planetary interiors, understanding seismic and volcanic processes, natural hazard mitigation, advancing sensor technologies and developing geophysical data analysis algorithms. In\u00a0this context, a non-negligible number of our graduates prosecuted their career path with a Ph.D. in geophysics (both in Italy and \u00a0abroad) and are now continuing their careers in the scientific research sector as post-doc or research staff members in many important universities and research centres around the world.\nback to top\nMenu\nHome\nDocuments for students\nDocuments for administration\nFuture Students\nThe MSc Program in Geophysics\nWhy study Geophysics?\nStudy Path and Courses\nApplication\nCurrent Students\nAvailable Theses\nInternational mobility\nFinal Exam\nAcademic Calendar\nList of Tutors\nOrganization\nTraining Activities\nVerbali e SUA-Cds, SMA, RRC\nFormer Students\nAlumni\nJob Placement\nTheses List\ngea@dst.unipi.it\n\u00a9 2024 Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nPolicy web"}

Such skills will make our graduates able to face and solve different types of geophysical, geological, and engineering problems in a broad range of contexts. Our MSc\u00a0is strategically divided into three specialized paths, each offering a unique set of skills highly requested by the job market.\nPath I\nExploration Geophysics\nThis curriculum is tailored to equip ou studends with the skills and knowledge needed to characterize the Earth's subsurface at different scales. Exploration geophysics allow to image the subsurface using different geophysical investigation methods and\u00a0play a central role in the search of conventional and renewable energy sources as well as the monitoring of underground CO2 storage operations.\nPath II\nApplied Geophysics\nWith this curriculum, our students gain hands-on experience in utilizing geophysical methods to solve practical problems in engineering and environmental contexts. Applied geophysicists play a crucial role as key professionals in evaluating subsurface conditions for construction projects, monitoring and conducting non-destructive testing of civil infrastructures, assessing groundwater resources, and engaging in environmental monitoring and remediation, to cite a few examples.\nPath III\nEarthquake and Volcano Physics\nIn this curriculum, our students acquire knowledge of the physical mechanisms governing earthquakes and volcanic processes. A deeper understanding of the Earth's dynamic processes is crucial for implementing more efficient risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This research-oriented curriculum is particularly suited for those aspiring to pursue a career in academia or research centers.\nWhether your passion lies in resource exploration, engineering and environmetal applications, or natural hazard mitigation, our Master program ensures that you will graduate with a comprehensive skill set that will make you successfull in the next step of your career.

Overall, the geophysical market is extremely large and includes many industrial sectors such as energy and georesources exploration, environmental protection and restoration, civil engineering, and cultural heritage.\nEnergy and Georesources\nThe energy sector is certainly the main player in the geophysical market. Here geophysics is extensively used for the exploration of conventional and renewable energy resources (e.g. geothermal resources) but also for the induced seismicity monitoring associated with underground industrial operations (e.g. Geothermal Enrgy Production and CO2 storage operations). Thanks to the strict connection of the MSc in Exploration and Applied Geophysics with companies operating in this sector, many of our graduates got a job at ENI (the major energy company in Italy) or in geophysical companies such as Schlumberger, CGG, PGS, and many others.\nEnvironmental and Civil Engineering\nAlthough smaller but not less important, the environmental and civil engineering sector, mainly represented by small-to-medium size companies, holds a good fraction of the geophysical market. Here geophysics is used to assist the design of large infrastructures (tunnels, highways, bridges) but also for detecting and tracking pollutants (just to make a few examples). Also in this case many alumni of our MSc program currently work in such companies or founded their own companies and startups.\nScientific Research\nGeophysics plays a pivotal role in diverse research areas, including exploring planetary interiors, understanding seismic and volcanic processes, natural hazard mitigation, advancing sensor technologies and developing geophysical data analysis algorithms. In\u00a0this context, a non-negligible number of our graduates prosecuted their career path with a Ph.D. in geophysics (both in Italy and \u00a0abroad) and are now continuing their careers in the scientific research sector as post-doc or research staff members in many important universities and research centres around the world.\nback to top\nMenu\nHome\nDocuments for students\nDocuments for administration\nFuture Students\nThe MSc Program in Geophysics\nWhy study Geophysics?\nStudy Path and Courses\nApplication\nCurrent Students\nAvailable Theses\nInternational mobility\nFinal Exam\nAcademic Calendar\nList of Tutors\nOrganization\nTraining Activities\nVerbali e SUA-Cds, SMA, RRC\nFormer Students\nAlumni\nJob Placement\nTheses List\ngea@dst.unipi.it\n\u00a9 2024 Earth Science Department - University of Pisa\nPolicy web"}

Our program has a rich history of producing skilled geophysicists who have made significant contributions to the field. Here, we celebrate the achievements and success stories of our esteemed alumni.\nAlumni Profiles\nMrs. Greta Tresoldi, Product and Marketing Manager at LSI LASTEM, Class of 2016\nGreta currently holds the position of Product and Marketing Manager at LSI LASTEM, a company specializing in the design, production, and distribution of environmental monitoring solutions across various sectors. One of her key responsibilities involves leading the development of the G.Re.T.A. system, an innovative autonomous geo-resistivimeter designed for long-term geoelectrical monitoring, leveraging cloud-based technology for enhanced functionality.\n\u201cIn my experience pursuing an MSc in Exploration and Applied Geophysics at Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, I found myself immersed in an exceptional academic environment. Not only did I uncover my passion for shallow Geophysics and its integral relationship with hydrogeological risk prevention, but I also witnessed firsthand the University's dedication to providing practical studies tailored to real-world applications. What truly sets apart the program is the support from Professors who are genuinely invested in helping students navigate their way into the professional world. Their guidance has been invaluable, paving the way for me to seamlessly transition from academia to the workforce. In fact, my thesis project remains the cornerstone of my current work.\nTo any aspiring Geoscientists considering embarking on this journey, I encourage you to seize the opportunity. The rich learning environment, coupled with the hands-on experience and dedicated mentorship, will undoubtedly equip you with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the dynamic world of Geophysics.\u201d\n\u2014 Greta Tresoldi\nMrs. Chiara Cocorullo, Co-fouder and geophysicist at SEISMIX, Class of 2011\nChiara is a geophysicist specialized in microseismic monitoring and management of seismic networks. After a career path in research and several geophysical companies, she cofounded\nSEISMIX\n, an innovative startup and UniPi\nspin-off\noffering microseismic monitoring services for the industries working in the geoenergy sector.\n\"The MSc program at the University of Pisa provided me with a comprehensive skill set that has been invaluable in my career. The strong foundation in physics and geology coupled with specialized geophysical knowledge and advanced computational skills, opened doors to many opportunities in the industry and were essential in allowing me to became a co-founder of the startup SEISMIX.\"\n\u2014 Chiara Cocorullo\nDr. Ettore Biondi, Research Seismologist at Caltech, US, Class 2012\nEttore is currently a research seismologist at Caltech in California, USA. Ettore earned a PhD in Geophysics at Stanford University, where he developed new methodologies for elastic and acoustic full-waveform inversion. At Caltech, he started to focus on photonic seismology topics, specifically in the development of new methodologies for real-time analysis and subsurface monitoring and imaging of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data.\n\"During my MSc studies at the University of Pisa, I fell in love with seismic imaging and computer simulation of natural phenomena. The broad and solid background in signal processing and data inversion I gained during that time has been the basis upon which I built any discoveries I made so far.

With our project we aim at developing methods for using OT to trap and spectroscopically characterize (Raman Tweezers) extraterrestrial dust particles and/or their analogs. This study will provide solid ground for the application of OT techniques in the near future to solar system study, e.g., cometary particles analyses including the volatile component, dust particles in the Martian atmosphere and/or on the Martian, Lunar surfaces.

Previous investigations on glaciovolcanic lithofacies in northern Victoria Land by members of this team yielded modern paleoclimate-paleoenvironment reconstructions for late Miocene-Pliocene (10-2 Ma), a period in which the Antarctic ice sheet was subjected to warmer conditions than present. In this area, cliffs exposes superb sections of late Miocene shield volcanoes, constructed by multiple eruptions in 2-3 Ma. The warm late Miocene was also characterised by polythermal ice, and is critical for inferring what can be expected in the near future if global warming will persist. Our paleoenvironmental study will also fill in a major gap in the offshore record and is significantly ultra-proximal (ice-contact) with respect to any associated glacial cover, allowing a local, yet widely applicable perspective. MAGIC will also investigate the modulating effects of glacial ice fluctuations on the eruption frequency and magma composition. Dynamic variations in the ice cap extent/thickness modify the state of stress in the crust, which in turn influences the duration and pressure of magma storage in shallow reservoirs. Thus, during glacial periods (high glacial load), magma storage is relatively prolonged, enhancing chemical differentiation. As a consequence, eruption of volatile- and incompatible element-enriched magmas may be favoured upon glacial retreat. MAGIC is designed to investigate, for the first time in Antarctica, the relationships between glacial loading conditions and composition of erupted magmas, also using numerical simulations. This will establish whether feedback exists between glacial conditions and volcanism in this part of the planet.\nback to top\nArchivio Progetti di Ricerca\n\u00a9 2024 Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nPolicy web"}

As this project has the objective of exhaustively explore the interactions between the tropical and polar areas, INQUA-MARE workshops will bring together micropaleontologists, modellers, geochemists, sedimentologists, oceanographers and geophysicists to discuss the pivotal drivers of oceanographic (e.g. the closure or opening of seaways) and atmospheric changes (e.g. those related to readjustment of marine currents), their feedback on climate and environmental characteristics, particularly addressing the timing of responses. Some of the \u201ctechnical\u201d themes that will be discussed during the workshops are: A) the comparison and integration of the analytical data obtained by different research groups, encouraging their share through the use of free online databases; B) the discussion on inter-laboratories standardisation of analytical procedure; C) the identification of unexploited existing sedimentary records (sediment cores) or survey datasets (e.g. oceanographic and geophysical data, etc.). On the other hand, the scientific discussion will address: A) the interpretation of proxies; B) the definition of the state-of-the-art about pole-to-pole teleconnections; C) the identification of Pacific versus Atlantic connection as responsible for the heat transport between the Polar areas. These topics will be faced during round table discussions, opened by key-talk presentation of Senior Scientists, who will introduce the state-of-the-art on specific topic, and will help to define the main points that should be addressed for the discussion. 4 workshops will be organised addressing the i) the Antarctic realm, ii) the Arctic realm, iii) the Tropical realms, and iv) the interaction between Polar and Tropical areas. The first two workshops will be held in Italy (in Trieste and Pisa, respectively), while the 3rd and the 4th workshops will be held in two of the countries of the Developing Countries Researchers involved in the project (Costa Rica, and Tunisia).\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.inqua.org/commissions/cmp/projects/2002P\nback to top\nArchivio Progetti di Ricerca\n\u00a9 2024 Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nPolicy web"}

In the recent years, a conspicuous part of the scientific community has focused on the Antarctic climate variability of the last 2000 years (CLIVASH2k working group of PAGES) because this interval provides critical information about Earth's climate natural variability versus changes induced by human activities. Within the framework of Line A of the PNRA_2018 call, the EDISTHO (Edisto inlet DIatom laminations Sequences Through the Holocene) research team undertakes a multidiscliplinary approach on sedimentary, seismic and oceanographic existing data collected within the Edisto Inlet. Indeed, data collected in the framework of past PNRA projects (i.e. BAY 2004/4.10, HOLOFERNE 2013/A2.03, TRACERS 2016-A3.05, GLEVORS A4_16_00293) indicate that the Edisto Inlet preserves an expanded sedimentary record, which mainly consists of yearly to decennal diatom laminations. However, those projects had different scientific objectives from the detailed studies of diatom laminae proposed here. As such, the high-resolution analysis of those cores has never been attempted before partly because the detailed study of diatom laminae requires specific, complex and expensive techniques. We want to address our research to the detailed study of these records, not only studying the laminae sequences, but also investigating the oceanographic and geomorphobathymetry condition that lead to the deposition of such an expanded record. Also sediment cores collected in the continental shelf basins will be analysed to distinguish local climatic signals in the Edisto Inlet from the regional ones.\nback to top\nArchivio Progetti di Ricerca\n\u00a9 2024 Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nPolicy web"}

It is unclear how the migration of extension impacts on the timing, type, and distribution of volcanism and how the newly formed zones of extension at the rift axis interact to form the breakup boundary between two new plates. In this project we will combine different disciplines (structural geology, stratigraphy, geochemistry, petrology, and geophysics) to obtain new constraints on the distribution of strain and magmatism in Afar (Ethiopia). We will target two locations, the Afar rift floor where tectonic extension and magmatism is currently active, and the Afar rift margin where tectonic extension is thought to have been focused in the past. Our aim is to understand whether a temporal correlation exists between extension and subsidence along the rift margin and the genesis, rise and emplacement of the Afar flood basalts in the rift floor (\u2018Afar stratoids\u2019). Another important focus is to understand whether extension and magma resurfacing was distributed across the rift floor or it localized across narrow rifts that have progressively migrated.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.afarstratoid.com\nback to top\nArchivio Progetti di Ricerca\n\u00a9 2024 Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nPolicy web"}

The distinction among processes, tectonic setting and depth of melanges formation represents a significant aspect to detail the tectonic evolution of these orogenic belts. However, during the multistage evolution of orogenic belts, the complex interaction and superposition of different processes, mechanisms and metamorphic recrystallization overprint and rework the primary (original) block-in-matrix fabric of tectonic, sedimentary and (mud and serpentinite) diapiric m\u00e9langes, forming the so-called \u201cpolygenetic m\u00e9langes\u201d. Not surprinsingly, then, contrasting interpretations and models have been proposed for m\u00e9langes, their orgins, and consequently for the tectonic evolution of orogenic belts. For the first time, a multidisciplinary and multi-scale approach (geological mapping, structural, stratigraphic, sedimentological, paleontological, petrological, mineralogical and geochemical integrated investigations associeted to quantitative geodinamic modelling) will be adopted to improve significantly the understanding of \u201cpolygenetic melanges\u201d formed in different tectonic settings and at different depths and P-T-t conditions during a complete orogenic cycle (from rifting to subduction, collision and exhumation). We will focus on the m\u00e9langes of the Alps and Apennines belts where notable examples of different types of m\u00e9lange originated at different structural levels and depths are well preserved. Expected results are aimed at providing a modern view on the (i) the mode and significance of \u201cpolygenetic melange\u201d formation, (ii) the nature of the continuum of their disruption and mixing from shallower to deeper structural levels (i.e., from non-metamorphic up to HP-UHP metamorphic conditions), and (iii) the criteria useful to differentiate their genetic processes. We will finally deliver a new methodological protocol for their distinction and interpretation as fundamental markers of tectonic events in global orogenic belts. Within this frame, the societal impact will be explored as well, regarding the role of the m\u00e9langes in geological hazards (e.g., earthquakes and landslides) and their environmental impact in the production of raw material and in their bearing on human health hazard (as asbestos dispersion and potentially toxic elements bioavailability).\nback to top\nArchivio Progetti di Ricerca\n\u00a9 2024 Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nPolicy web"}

They are characterized by a sedimentation rate significantly higher than that of the surrounding hemipelagic sediments and by a relative continuity of sedimentation. As such, they are excellent paleoclimatic archives that may allow the reconstruction of past ocean dynamics and of the glacial history of the adjacent continent. The Eastern sector of the Ross Sea continental slope is a poorly studied area (also for its frequent sea ice cover) that includes several sediment drifts. With this project we aim to study the paleoceanographic conditions that lead to the growth of these sediment drifts and the present ocean circulation in the area. This study will allow to reconstruct past and present ocean dynamics and to gather indirect evidence on the glacial history of this Antarctic sector.\nback to top\nArchivio Progetti di Ricerca\n\u00a9 2024 Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nPolicy web"}

The PhD student will integrate the developing ice-core tephrochronology into regional tephrochronological frameworks from both hemispheres allowing to study the size/frequency distribution of volcanism in different regions since the last ice age.\nSupervisor:\nProf. Michael Sigl\n, University of Bern, +41 31 631 8652,\nmichael.sigl@climate.unibe.ch\nQualification requirements\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strong analytical skills and a Master's degree in physics, chemistry, geosciences (or related)\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fluent spoken and written English are prerequisites for this position\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0excellent collaboration skills and ability to successfully join in academic teamwork within and across disciplines\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0experience in the use of geochemical analytical techniques or tephra analyses is advantageous\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0some experience in statistics, database management and programming would be beneficial\nThey offer\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a fully-funded position for 4 years (salary according to Swiss National Science Foundation rules)\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a professionally stimulating working environment in a small team\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the student will benefit from the support of an active, interdisciplinary research environment.

I am Varun Khajuria, an enthusiastic explorer of mountain ecosystems and their water resources. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Geoscience and Environment at the University of Pisa, my academic journey reflects a dedicated pursuit of knowledge and hands-on experience in the realm of water resources. I initiated my career by obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from (2013-2017). During this period, my interest in Water resources took root while working on my final graduation project, which delved into the intricacies of \u201cscour around circular compound bridge piers\u201d. Motivated by this newfound passion, I further honed my expertise by enrolling in a Master's in Technology program in Water Resources Engineering (2019- 2021). The focal point of my thesis was the study of snowmelt runoff in a mountainous catchment, demonstrating my commitment to understanding the hydrological dynamics of challenging terrains. Subsequently, I transitioned into the role of a Research Scientist at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, ISRO. For more than two years, I contributed significantly to the project titled \"Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) Geoportal with Allied Database Development for UT Ladakh Sub-Theme: Integrated Water Resources Study for the Assessment of Water Availability, Water-Ice Harvesting and Flood Hazard Mapping\". Here, my responsibilities centered around investigating water availability in Himalayan catchments and conducting site suitability analyses for water ice harvesting structures in the Ladakh Himalayas.

They research project aims to optimise the road traffic distribution as mitigation action for road traffic noise exposition on sensitive receivers in the urban environment. Noise is caused by anthropogenic action on the environment and is one of the major environmental problems in Europe. The main source of noise pollution in cities is generated by road traffic and its prolonged exposure can cause significant health risk such as hearing damage, annoyance, affect mortality, sleep disturbance, cognitive interference processes and generally hit people's quality of life. The development of a sustainable action plan to mitigate community noise exposure is an incisive action towards the 2050 vision of a Healthy Planet for All, which sets out in the Zero Pollution Action Plan issued by the European Union a 30% reduction of noise exposure before 2030.\nAlexandra L.

During my undergraduate studies at the University of Palermo, I actively participated in a stimulating oceanographic campaign in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea aboard the research vessel \"Minerva UNO\" of the National Research Council (CNR) in Naples, contributing significantly to seismic data acquisition. In the following academic year, I study the sediment cores collected from the seafloor of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, conducting detailed analyses of their content and characteristics at the sedimentology laboratory of the CNR in Naples.\nIn 2022, I seized a significant research opportunity by obtaining a scholarship within the framework of the \"SPHERITAGE - Lessons for the future from the cultural heritage of the past\" project. During this project, I played a key role in editing a detailed geomorphological map (scale 1:25,000) of the continental shelf in front of the archaeological site of Balzi Rossi, utilizing high-resolution bathymetric data. Additionally, I acted as a scientific supervisor aboard the research vessel \"Portovado I\" during a high-resolution seismic data acquisition campaign in the Liguro-Proven\u00e7al continental shelf. Subsequently, I conducted the processing and interpretation of seismic data.\nMy current research project aims to identify submerged areas that were once exposed during periods of low sea level and may have hosted human settlements. The research integrates geological, geomorphological, and archaeological approaches to reconstruct the paleoenvironment and sea-level variations. The work includes modeling submerged marine terraces, sedimentological analysis, core dating, and the utilization of sea-level curves extracted from glacio-hydro-isostatic models. This trajectory reflects my dedication to underwater exploration and understanding the dynamics shaping the seafloor.\nAcademic Background:\n- B.Sc. in Geological Sciences at the University of Palermo, 2018.

My PhD project aims to address the delay in the preservation of paleontological geosites by professionals in the field, developing measures to enhance the \"ex situ\" heritage (specimens stored in museum collections) and measures to protect the \"in situ\" heritage (outcropping or sub-outcropping fossiliferous rocks), with the goal of integrating ex situ and in situ heritage into a comprehensive conservation and valorisation plan.\nPisa Province and its paleontological heritage represent an ideal \u201copen-air laboratory\u201d for the implementation of this project. The approach will include both basic research and applied palaeontology and the main research activities will focus on:\n- the revision and improvement of the atlas of Palaeontological Sites of the Province of Pisa;\n- the elaboration of strategies of \"preventive palaeontology\" aimed at the conservation of the in situ heritage using GIS software;\n- the digitisation of the main fossil outcrops and the corresponding ex situ palaeontological assets using structured light scanning and drone photogrammetry;\n- the promotion of palaeontological localities of prime national or international interest through the collection and analysis of new fossils and the revision of historical specimens.\nMy academic background has mainly focused on taphonomy, specifically the preservation of organic tissues such as feathers in fossils. This was the main topic of my B.Sc. degree and M.Sc. at \u201cSapienza\u201d University of Rome, first with a thesis on \u201cFossil evidence of feathers origin and evolution during the Mesozoic\u201d and then with the thesis \u201cThe fossil vulture (Gyps fulvus) from the Late Pleistocene of Alban Hills (Latium, Italy): organic tissues analysis and taphonomy\u201d.\nAfter the University, I worked in different museums as a collection manager. During the fellowship at MUST (Museo Universitario di Scienze della Terra) in the Department of Earth Sciences of Sapienza University in Rome (Italy), I worked in the Paleontological collection, in particular I dealt with cataloguing the quaternary mammal fossils. Then I participated in the Regional competition TornoSubito Call for the Latium Region (Italy), with a project about the conservation and cataloguing of natural history collection in Italy and the role of naturalist in XXI century and I made a Work Experience at MUSE - Science Museum Trento and at Museo Civico di Zoologia di Roma. In my last experience at the Museo Civico di Zoologia di Roma, as a volunteer inside the Servizio Civile Universale (Civil Service), I worked on the Museum collections as a collection manager and a museum conservator. I have carried out an activity of monitoring, review and updating of systematics and taxonomic information of specimens.

This motivates me to engage with geoethics and science communication, in both national and international levels.\nSince water is our most basic human need and most of the liquid freshwater is underground, hydrogeology was an opportunity to match geology with the needs of society. Thus, I\u2019ve got involved in projects regarding gender and groundwater in Brazil (NUCAT/UNESCO), and about the inclusion of marginalised rural communities in Laos and Cambodia through sustainable groundwater access and use (IWMI).

My research aims at contributing to understanding the impact of micro- and nanoplastic (MnP) contamination in groundwater and assessing the risk perception of such pollution on local communities. The project is characterised by being highly inter- and transdisciplinary. It includes the development of a stakeholder analysis and public engagement of groundwater users focused on MnP pollution. At the same time, develop a groundwater quality monitoring program to assess the occurrence of MnP at catchment scale, including sampling and measurement of major and trace elements, stable isotopes, emerging contaminants, and MnP analysis. The results will be used to develop an integrated analysis of risk perception on the actual presence of microplastics in groundwater in highly stressed aquifers.\nMSc. in Geological Engineering at the Federal University of Ouro Preto (Brazil), with a sandwich year at University College Cork (Ireland), 2017.

During my Master's degree in Geological Science and Technology, I specialised in geochemistry and isotopic geochemistry, in particular on fluid-rock interaction, mixing processes, water origin and traceability. After graduation, I had the opportunity to work for 3 years as a Scholar Fellow at the Institute of Geosciences and Georesources (IGG-CNR), where I participated in many research projects in the field of hydrology and geochemistry of water and soils. This allowed me to deepen my knowledge of isotope geochemistry and learn how to use different analytical tools by working in different laboratories. With this background, in march 2023 I started a PhD research project to understand the origin, distribution and behaviour of lithium in deep saline waters hosted by sedimentary formations along the Northern Apennine foredeep. Research will consist in an integrate geoscience approach of field work and geochemical and isotopic analyses on different geological matrices (waters and rock) and conceptual modelling of Li cycle in Neogene sedimentary formation, aiming to promote sustainable methods for Li extraction and recovery from waters and brines.\nB.

Furthermore, there is a need to constrain long-term commitments to future sea level rise and the potential for ice sheet 'recovery' if society is able to limit or reverse warming. It is well understood that fluctuations in the volume and extent of Antarctica's ice sheets (AIS) are primarily controlled by changes in global climate due to variation in incoming solar radiation due to orbital variations, surface reflectivity (albedo), and greenhouse gas concentrations. Regional changes in ocean circulation also have an effect. Furthermore, the AIS is sensitive to changes in topography over longer time periods. However, questions regarding the role that these different drivers have played in controlling ice sheet variability through time remain. Reconstructions of past ice sheet behaviour from the geological record offer a means to examine the influence of predictable orbital variations and to identify critical planetary thresholds that have affected ice sheet behaviour. These ice sheet reconstructions are often derived from far field records, which offer highly resolved, near continuous records over the past 34 million years. However, ice sheet proximal data are required to constrain interpretations based on far-field data.\nOver forty years of scientific drilling and seismic data acquisition along the Antarctic margin provide a direct record of AIS variability. Drill cores recovered from the Ross Sea reveal a composite stratigraphy that spans the past 34 million years. Extensive marine seismic surveys across the region define stratigraphic packages that are linked to glacial processes and help constrain glacial history. Importantly, the location of this unique stratigraphic archive captures the evolution of ice sheets in both East and West Antarctica. We have established an integrated stratigraphy for the Ross Sea using new biostratigraphic data and revised core descriptions. This integrated framework offers a clear and coherent history of AIS variability and extent since the inception of isolated ice caps on the continental interior and mountains in the late Eocene. Whereas orbital forcing played an important role in AIS growth and retreat on glacial-interglacial timescales, proxy environmental data highlight fundamental thresholds in the climate system, across which the nature and behaviour of the AIS fundamentally changed. Importantly, these transitions suggest that the AIS is sensitive to relatively small changes in atmospheric CO\n2\nconcentrations, similar to those projected for the coming decades. Collection of new geological data from regions that are most vulnerable to climate change are required to test and build on our current understanding of AIS sensitivity. Our community challenge is to identify, fund, and drill these locations soon!\nback to top\nRead all News\nBandi e Avvisi\nGraduatoria Geogiglio\nChina Link Scholarship program\nISSNAF programma Mentoring\nCorsi di Laurea\nScienze Geologiche [GEO-L]\nScienze Naturali e Ambientali [NAT-L]\nScienze Ambientali [WSM-LM]\nExploration and Applied Geophysics (MSc) [WGF-LM]\nScienze e Tecnologie Geologiche [WGE-LM]\nGeology [GLY-L] (sede Uzbekistan)\nOrario delle lezioni\nConvenzioni attive per tirocini\nAttivit\u00e0\nArchivio notizie\nArchivio seminari\nBandi e avvisi\nBreve storia del Dipartimento\nEsami di stato\nOrientamento\nLogin\nPer accedere all'Area Risevata ( Verbali, mailing list ecc.) loggarsi le Credenziali di Ateneo\nUsername\nPassword\nDipartimento Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nVia S.

This is the case of diatoms, microscopic algae with a siliceous exoskeleton. As we know the ecological conditions of the modern oceans in which different diatom species live, when we found them in sedimentary rocks, we can infer the ecological conditions of the oceans millions of years ago. Here, we present the species that we found in some Peruvian rocks, the so-called Pisco Formation, which dates back to 7/6 Million of years ago. Different species are preserved in these rocks in the same order in which they bloomed, so that we can identify small \u201claminae\u201d (horizontal strips in the rock with thicknesses smaller than 1 mm) for each blooming season. The species that we recognize are those that today bloom during \u201cEl-Ni\u00f1o,\u201d a climatic warm condition that causes loss of large fishery stocks, inundations and droughts. This small finding helps us hypothesize how climate may evolve if the Earth's temperatures keep on rising. Also, the Pisco formation is famous because of their huge content of fossil whales and dolphins, thus the study of this rock helps us understand how these large mammals got preserved trough millions of years."}

CCS is the only immediately available option for reducing emissions in the so-called hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, steel, chemical and paper mills, etc. Geology and Geophysics (G&G) play a key role in the whole chain of storage site selection, characterization and monitoring. The lecture introduces the basic concepts of CO2 storage and shows how G&G disciplines contribute to the success of an industrial CCS projects.\nShort CV: Davide Della Moretta is the Head of the Basin Geology Department at Eni Headquarters, Milan. His department is in charge of structural geology, basin modeling and potential methods studies. Starting from 2020, he is also coordinating G&G studies for Eni's CCS projects. Before his current position, he has been involved in seismic data processing and acquisition, shallow hazard analysis, geopressure and R&D projects coordination.\nLocandina"}

However, modelling the structure and composition of the lithospheric mantle and the physico-chemical properties of the ascending kimberlite melts is not straightforward, because kimberlites appear as mixtures of mantle- and magmatic-derived phases, often pervaded by intense hydrothermal alteration. So, what information can we extract from kimberlites and their crystal cargo?\nIn this presentation, I will show how routine and high-precision electron microprobe analyses of the main mineral phases in fresh samples of the Udachnaya-East kimberlite (Siberia, Russia) can be used to:\n- discriminate the mantle-derived cargo from the \u201cmagmatic\u201d phases;\n- reconstruct the P-T-X-fO2 path of kimberlite melts;\n- model the interactions between kimberlite-related fluid/melts and the sub-cratonic lithosphere.\n2) Tom Griffiths - Cristallographic orientation mapping in magmatic petrology: new insights into crystal clustering\nFormation of crystal clusters has important impacts on the rheology and differentiation of crystal-bearing magmas. Determining the origin of crystal clusters is key to extracting petrological information from them, and improved understanding of clustering processes is needed in order to predict clustering behaviour and its effects on magmatic plumbing systems. Crystallographic orientation mapping, using the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique, is routine in metamorphic petrology but seldom applied to magmatic rocks and their experimental analogues. In this presentation I will demonstrate how EBSD can reveal the crystallographic orientation relationships between clustered crystals and how these orientation relationships may record information about both the mechanism and conditions of cluster formation as well as the modification of clusters after their formation.\nDownload attachments:\nCasetta_Seminar_Sept22.pdf\nGriffiths_Seminar_Sept22.pdf\nback to top\nRead all News\nBandi e Avvisi\nGraduatoria Geogiglio\nChina Link Scholarship program\nISSNAF programma Mentoring\nCorsi di Laurea\nScienze Geologiche [GEO-L]\nScienze Naturali e Ambientali [NAT-L]\nScienze Ambientali [WSM-LM]\nExploration and Applied Geophysics (MSc) [WGF-LM]\nScienze e Tecnologie Geologiche [WGE-LM]\nGeology [GLY-L] (sede Uzbekistan)\nOrario delle lezioni\nConvenzioni attive per tirocini\nAttivit\u00e0\nArchivio notizie\nArchivio seminari\nBandi e avvisi\nBreve storia del Dipartimento\nEsami di stato\nOrientamento\nLogin\nPer accedere all'Area Risevata ( Verbali, mailing list ecc.) loggarsi le Credenziali di Ateneo\nUsername\nPassword\nDipartimento Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nVia S.

So, what information can we extract from kimberlites and their crystal cargo?\nIn this presentation, I will show how routine and high-precision electron microprobe analyses of the main mineral phases in fresh samples of the Udachnaya-East kimberlite (Siberia, Russia) can be used to:\n- discriminate the mantle-derived cargo from the \u201cmagmatic\u201d phases;\n- reconstruct the P-T-X-fO2 path of kimberlite melts;\n- model the interactions between kimberlite-related fluid/melts and the sub-cratonic lithosphere.\n2) Tom Griffiths - Cristallographic orientation mapping in magmatic petrology: new insights into crystal clustering\nFormation of crystal clusters has important impacts on the rheology and differentiation of crystal-bearing magmas. Determining the origin of crystal clusters is key to extracting petrological information from them, and improved understanding of clustering processes is needed in order to predict clustering behaviour and its effects on magmatic plumbing systems. Crystallographic orientation mapping, using the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique, is routine in metamorphic petrology but seldom applied to magmatic rocks and their experimental analogues. In this presentation I will demonstrate how EBSD can reveal the crystallographic orientation relationships between clustered crystals and how these orientation relationships may record information about both the mechanism and conditions of cluster formation as well as the modification of clusters after their formation.\nDownload attachments:\nCasetta_Seminar_Sept22.pdf\nGriffiths_Seminar_Sept22.pdf"}

The collection in the upper stratosphere is a key point: at that altitude the terrestrial dust supply is limited, therefore the upper stratosphere is an excellent reservoir for extraterrestrial materials like Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs). Thanks to the DUSTER\u2019s efficient sampling system and the adoption of strict protocols for minimizing contamination, the particles collected do not require sample manipulation after collection and they are ready for identification and characterization directly on the instrument \u201ccollector\u201d (a sample holder with 13 TEM grids). Until now, DUSTER collected more than ~300 particles that range from 0.1 to 150 \u00b5m. The ambitious goal of DUSTER is to become a reference collection for uncontaminated extraterrestrial particles collected in the stratosphere, complementing micrometeorites and IDPs available at the Earth\u2019s surface. Their cosmochemical study is thus expected to provide new information on the composition of the inner Solar System interplanetary cosmic dust complex and its geochemical contribution to Earth - an outstanding issue in earth and planetary science and astrophysics.\nDownload attachments:\nMusolino_abstract.pdf"}

It represents an important contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the IEA\u2019s Sustainable Development Scenario and an effective tool to reduce the so called \u2018hard to abate\u2019 industrial emissions.\nIn the first part of the presentation the technical basics of CCS will be described, including the global CCS status and some issues related to the peculiarity of CO2 phase behavior. The second part will be devoted to the geological and geophysical studies needed to guarantee the feasibility and the safety of CO2 injection operations. Modeling, monitoring and storage complex characterization will be described taking advantage of Eni\u2019s experience in such topics.\nShort Biography\nDavide Della Moretta graduates in 2001 at Universit\u00e0 Statale, Milan, with a thesis on seismic tomography. After an internship with Total, in 2005 he joins Eni as seismic processing geophysicist. In 2009-10 he works as Geophysical Operations Coordinator in Eni Pakistan. Back to Eni\u2019s headquarters he joins the Geopressure unit as technical leader, working in seismic-derived pressure prediction and shallow hazards. In 2012 he is appointed as G&G R&D unit manager until 2015, when he moved to the Italian mineral rights unit until 2017. He is now manager of the Basin Geology Studies unit.\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina_CO2.pdf"}

P. Xypolias (Patras University Grecee) terr\u00e0 un seminario dal titolo\n\"Geology of Greece\".\nThe geologic history of Greece is dominated by the development of the Alpine orogenic belt of Hellenides, which form an orocline connecting the Dinarides to the NW with the Taurides to the SE. The Hellenides resulted from the closure of a series of interconnected Neo-Tethyan oceanic basins and the subsequent multiphase collision between Gondwana-derived continental fragments and Eurasia during Cretaceous to Oligocene times. Post-Oligocene tectonic activity is governed by the subduction of the Africa beneath Aegean microplate.\nThe Hellenides are commonly divided into three structural provinces, the External Hellenides, the Internal Hellenides and the Hellenic hinterland. The borders between these provinces are defined by the ophiolitic suture zones of Vardar and Pindos; although some studies question the occurrence of Pindos suture/ocean. The Alpine tectonic evolution of the Hellenides remains also controversial. Currently, popular tectonic models interpret the Hellenides as a unidirectional, SW-vergent orogenic belt. In this interpretation, the HP-units exposed in the Internal Hellenides are laterally equivalent to the external units and have been exhumed in the footwall of syn- and/or post-orogenic extensional detachments. However, several studies have shown that the exhumation of the internal HP-units is related to NE-directed thrusting emphasizing the importance of retroward movements in the orogenic evolution of Hellenides. This presentation discusses facts and controversies for the orogenic evolution of Hellenides and provides a general outline of the major lithotectonic units/zones, the Mesozoic palaeogeography, the Alpine deformation and the Active Tectonics in the area.\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina"}

These Oligocene ages with negative \u03b5Hf indicate a volcanic source region in the central-southern Alps. Though young by geological means, these zircons record an extraordinary geodynamic history. They originated in a volcanic arc, during the convergence/collision of the the Adria microplate with Europe from ca. 65 to 30 Ma. Thereafter, the Oligocene zircons travelled ca. 400 km southward along the Adria margin and the accretionary prism to present-day Tuscany, where they were subducted to depths of at least 40 km. Shortly thereafter, they were brought to the surface again in the wake of hinge roll back of the Apennine subduction zone and the resulting rapid extensional exhumation. Such a zircon roller coaster requires a microplate that has back-to-back subduction zones with opposing polarities on two sides.\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina"}

A classical view held that the current asteroid belt represents a tiny fraction (~0.1%) of a once-much-more massive population of planetesimals formed in-situ. Due to their being separated \"at birth\", asteroids were thought to have escaped major evolutionary processes typical of larger planets. As a consequence, asteroids have been largely regarded as primordial relicts of the early Solar System, thus spawning interest in their space exploration. Reconnaissance of first Main Belt asteroids by the Galileo and NEAR missions seemed to support this view.\nIn recent years, other new ideas have emerged. The overall orbital architecture of the Solar System implies large-scale mobility of the giant planets. In some of the extreme scenarios, the primordial Main Belt is dismantled and reassembled by a migrating Jupiter within the first million of years of formation. Later dynamical instabilities would also add radial mobility resulting in vigorous mixing in the Main Belt region. In these modern views, the Main Belt acts as a melting pot, collecting objects scattered from the four corners of the Solar System: from the terrestrial planet region to the outer trans-neptunian disk.\nThe exploration of these relatively accessible small worlds, thus, provides us with an unparalleled means to study the broader issues of Solar System formation, such as the formation location and internal evolution of planetesimals.

A classical view held that the current asteroid belt represents a tiny fraction (~0.1%) of a once-much-more massive population of planetesimals formed in-situ. Due to their being separated \"at birth\", asteroids were thought to have escaped major evolutionary processes typical of larger planets. As a consequence, asteroids have been largely regarded as primordial relicts of the early Solar System, thus spawning interest in their space exploration. Reconnaissance of first Main Belt asteroids by the Galileo and NEAR missions seemed to support this view.\nIn recent years, other new ideas have emerged. The overall orbital architecture of the Solar System implies large-scale mobility of the giant planets. In some of the extreme scenarios, the primordial Main Belt is dismantled and reassembled by a migrating Jupiter within the first million of years of formation. Later dynamical instabilities would also add radial mobility resulting in vigorous mixing in the Main Belt region. In these modern views, the Main Belt acts as a melting pot, collecting objects scattered from the four corners of the Solar System: from the terrestrial planet region to the outer trans-neptunian disk.\nThe exploration of these relatively accessible small worlds, thus, provides us with an unparalleled means to study the broader issues of Solar System formation, such as the formation location and internal evolution of planetesimals. The Dawn mission at Vesta and Ceres has paved the way for these in-depth investigations, but also showed that the study of these fundamental issues is complicated by billions of years of collisional evolution.\nThe great challenge for future missions, such as Lucy and Psyche, lies in being able to tease out primordial and evolutionary processes in order to reach a deeper understanding of our Solar System formation."}

The project focuses on the cosmochemical study of two unique collections of cosmic dust already available in our laboratories: the Transantarctic Mountain collection and the DUSTER (Dust in the Upper Stratosphere Tracking Experiment and Retrieval) collection. The composition of the dust complex in the inner Solar System (seen from Earth as the zodiacal cloud) is the outstanding issue in astrophysics and planetary science that we would like to address. This will allow us to obtain further information on the nature of all the dust producing bodies including asteroids, comets, an.d perhaps planets and their satellites.\nProf. Chiara Montomoli\n\u201cThe subducton and exhumation of the continental lithosphere: their effects on the structure and evolution of the orogens\u201d\nShort abstract -\u00a0Active collisional orogens represent exceptional natural laboratories for testing theories and geodynamic models. Formed as a consequence of continental collision between India and Asia, which began at about 55 Ma, the Himalaya-Karakorum belt is the most prominent \u201clarge-hot\u201d orogen on Earth; the intensity and the extent of the still active orogenetic processes are evident from the occurrence of the highest mountains on Earth, the high seismicity and the highest exhumation rates measured in collisional orogens so far (Zeitler et al. 1993). Different tectonic models have been formulated so far to explain the tectono-metamorphic evolution of the Himalayan orogen: most of them are based on the role of two E-W trending, N-dipping, first-order tectonic lineaments occurring all along the belt, i.e. the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS), bounding the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS), one of the major tectonic unit of the Himalaya representing the metamorphic core of the belt. However recent studies, allowed to recognise several ductile shear zones within the GHS. Preliminary data suggest that these discontinuities represent a first-order tectonic feature running for several hundred kilometres and dividing the GHS in two different portions (Montomoli et al., 2015). Aim of the project is to study the mechanism allowing the evolution of large hot orogens and to constraint the evolution of the continental lithosphere during its exhumation by a multitechnique approach."}

Among the most pressing questions related to these threats is how the coastal biodiversity will be impacted. Coastal wetland-based archives have an exceptional scientific potential to observe past biodiversity changes and identify key thresholds for particular ecosystems facing relative sea-level rise. Using fossil insects as main bioindicator to reconstruct the biodiversity and habitat changes, supplemented by pollen and geochemical data, I will present the long-term environmental history of two Corsican coastal wetlands located in different contexts: one on a low-laying island and the other on a deltaic floodplain. The two sites show contrasted ecosystem trajectories, and the results demonstrate the influence of the geomorphological context and land-use in the responses of these wetlands to Holocene relative sea-level rise.\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina Poher"}

The Penguin Lifelines project has adopted a novel approach to monitoring, which makes large-scale conservation efforts feasible. Together with the Australian Antarctic Division we have ~140 remote time-lapse cameras, spread across the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula. The wealth of photographic information generated by this camera network is processed with the help of citizen science through the Penguin Watch project (https://www.penguinwatch.org) - part of a larger citizen science platform: Zooniverse (https://www.zooniverse.org).\nMy PhD project aims to use the data generated by Penguin Watch to examine the health of specific penguin colonies and to better understand the threats they face. These include climate change (and related changes in sea ice distribution), pollution and fishing (particularly of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which is a keystone species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem). In this DST invited lecture I will talk about my most recent trip to the Antarctic and how the work we do is helping to inform conservation policy and increase public recognition of the increasing climatic and industrial problems developing in the Antarctic.\nSome details about Fiona Jones:\nA 3rd Year PhD student on the DTP programme at Oxford University [Green Templeton College].\n1.\nDownload attachments:\nFiona_Jones_(1).pdf"}

On a global scale, clean water for human consumption and crop rrigation ranks amongst the greatest societal challenges. Water management requires addressing the challenges of (amongst others) developing reliable and cost-efficient methods for mapping water resources and for predicting the spatio-temporal dynamics of hydrogeochemical processes. These challenges are exacerbated by the changing climate that will result in, among other things, increases in drought periods and sudden floods. Hydrogeophysics and hydrology are the key methods for addressing these challenges thanks to their ability to map and monitor the subsurface and to measure, model and predict groundwater flow.\nSHORT BIOGRAPHY\nGianluca Fiandaca is Associate Professor in Hydrogeophysics at the Department of Geoscience of the Aarhus University (Denmark). He has key expertise in electric and electromagnetic methods and integration with hydrological data for improved mapping of groundwater resources, development of geophysical processing and inversion algorithms and geophysical characterization of contaminated sites, landfills and leachate plumes.\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina Fiandaca"}

The Holocene marine transgression reached river valleys several kilometers upstream from the present-day coast, while in the last 7000 \u2013 6000 years it was followed by progradation of the Mirna and Neretva intra-estuarine deltas. Sediment cores recorded these changes and each depositional environment contains distinctive sedimentary characteristics and fossil assemblages which reflect conditions in which sedimentation and life were occurring.

We set the width of the TALP in relation to the inferred amount of collisional shortening and exhumation along six orogen-scale cross sections. Taking the present-day, along-strike gradients in the amount of collisional shortening to represent the temporal evolution of the collisional wedge, it may be concluded that the cross-sectional area of the TALP diminishes during ongoing shortening, indicating that the erosional flux outpaced the accretionary flux. Higher amounts of collisional shortening systematically coincide with smaller widths of the TALP and dramatic increases of the reconstructed eroded rock column. Higher amounts of shortening also coincide with larger amplitudes of orogen-scale, upright folds, with higher exhumation and with higher exhumation rates. Hence, erosion did play a major role in reducing by >30 km the vertical crustal thickness in order to accommodate and allow shortening by folding. Long-term climate differences cannot explain alternating changes of width by a factor of almost 2 along straight segments of the orogen on length scales less than 200 km, as observed from the western Central Alps to the easternmost Eastern Alps. Sedimentary or paleontological evidences supporting such paleo-climatic differences are lacking, suggesting that erosional processes did not directly control the width of the orogen.\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina"}

In addition, a very dense spatial sampling was adopted to acquire three GPR datasets summing about 2700 m of GPR profiles. Data post-processing was based on advanced vector imaging techniques, providing a full three-dimensional reconstruction of the response recorded from the burial chamber walls. No reflection induced by empty spaces or man-made discontinuities was detected behind the north and west wall, indicating that no hidden chamber is located immediately adjacent to the Tutankhamon\u2019s tomb (ref.1).\nThe talk will describe the context of the research and the results obtained by our work, with a specific focus on non-conventional data acquisition strategies and post-processing techniques.\n[1] Nicholas Reeves, 2015.

Their study allows us to investigate the geological diversity of the early Solar System and to explore proto-geological processes operating on small bodies \u2013 processes such as thermal metamorphism, aqueous alteration, planetary differentiation and core formation.\nEvery year several thousand tons of cosmic dust fall to Earth, forming metallic ion layers in the Earth's atmosphere, adding geochemically \"exotic\" elements to the Earth's surface (e.g. iridium) and potentially affecting the Earth's climate and biosphere. The study of micrometeorites is therefore concerned with the early Solar System and the interaction between Earth and interplanetary space.\nWhilst at Pisa I have been employed as a post-doc researcher with the research title: \"The cosmochemical study of Antarctic micrometeorites\". I am interested in the interaction between water-ice and silicate rock, a process termed aqueous alteration and considered the defining geological activity on comets and water-rich asteroids.

Knowing the past sea conditions is necessary for establishing natural reference values in order to better understand the causes and consequences of current changes.\nKatrine Husum Ph.D.\nSenior research scientist, arctic paleoceanography (professor level)\nScientific research department at the Norwegian Polar Institute\nScientific interests: Plio - Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoceanography and palaeoclimate in high latitude and Arctic regions; Natural and anthropogenic environmental changes in the Arctic; Developing and calibrating proxies for palaeoceanography and modern environmental monitoring\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina_K._Husum_2.pdf"}

Etgen received a bachelor of science degree in geophysical engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in 1985 and a Ph.D. in geophysics from Stanford\u00a0 university in 1990. During his studies, he had the good fortune to work on a wide variety of topics in seismic imaging and data processing while learning from his mentors, Jon Claerbout and Norm Bleistein, along with many talented colleagues and fellow students. His thesis studied new-at-the-time prestack migration-driven tomographic techniques for velocity estimation. That experience taught him the true difficulties of inverse problems. Leaving Stanford behind, he began his industrial career in late 1990 at the Amoco Production Research Company in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Unlike many new Ph.D. graduates, he did not want to continue to work on his thesis topic! Fortunately, once again he had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of topics and learn from leading researchers, such as Dan Whitmore, Rusty Alford, Kurt Marfurt, Ken Kelley, Sam Gray, and any others. In 1999, Amoco merged with British Petroleum (BP) and John moved to Houston, Texas. His role was senior scientist and then senior scientific advisor for seismic imaging at BP. In 2008, he and Carl Regone were awarded the Virgil Kauffman medal for their work in wide-azimuth marine seismic. In late 2011, John was appointed distinguished advisor for seismic imaging at BP.

So far 11 GSSPs have been established. They include 4 GSSPs for the base of the Paibian Stage, the Guzhangian Stage, the Jiangshanian Stage and the Wuliuan Stage of the Cambrian System; 3 GSSPs for the base of the Darriwilian Stage, the Dapingian Stage and the Hirnantian Stage of the Ordovician System; 2 GSSPs for the base of the Changhsingian Stage and the Wujiapingian Stage of the Permian System; one for the base of the Visean Stage of the Carboniferous System and one for the Permian/Triassic boundary.\nIn addition, there are several potential candidate GSSPs for the Paleozoic strata in South China. In particular the subdivision of the Carboniferous is not completed and the stratotypes of the base of 4 stages, including Serpukhovian of Mississippian, Moscovian, Kasimovian and Gzhelian of Pennsylvanian, are not yet defined. For this purpose, Carboniferous successions from the Naqing and adjacent sections of South China have been intensively investigated in the last decades focusing on biostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy.\nAttivit\u00e0\nQI Yuping ha svolto le sue ricerche come micropaleontologo e stratigrafo presso il Geological Scientific Research Institute, Shengli Petroleum Administration Bureau di Dongying, Shandong e presso il Geological Scientific Research Institute, Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau, Yangzhou, Jiangsu.

So far 11 GSSPs have been established. They include 4 GSSPs for the base of the Paibian Stage, the Guzhangian Stage, the Jiangshanian Stage and the Wuliuan Stage of the Cambrian System; 3 GSSPs for the base of the Darriwilian Stage, the Dapingian Stage and the Hirnantian Stage of the Ordovician System; 2 GSSPs for the base of the Changhsingian Stage and the Wujiapingian Stage of the Permian System; one for the base of the Visean Stage of the Carboniferous System and one for the Permian/Triassic boundary.\nIn addition, there are several potential candidate GSSPs for the Paleozoic strata in South China. In particular the subdivision of the Carboniferous is not completed and the stratotypes of the base of 4 stages, including Serpukhovian of Mississippian, Moscovian, Kasimovian and Gzhelian of Pennsylvanian, are not yet defined. For this purpose, Carboniferous successions from the Naqing and adjacent sections of South China have been intensively investigated in the last decades focusing on biostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy.\nAttivit\u00e0\nQI Yuping ha svolto le sue ricerche come micropaleontologo e stratigrafo presso il Geological Scientific Research Institute, Shengli Petroleum Administration Bureau di Dongying, Shandong e presso il Geological Scientific Research Institute, Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau, Yangzhou, Jiangsu.

Paolo Stocchi (NIOZ - Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, Texel, The Netherlands)\nTeams virtual room\nYouTube DST\nMarine sediments play a fundamental role in reconstructing past ice-sheets fluctuations. These are responsible for global ocean volume variations that can be extracted from the isotope record and that also show up as relative sea-level (RSL) changes in the geomorphological and stratigraphic records.The consequent bathymetric variations, which result in changes of accommodation space and distance from shore, affect the deposition of marine sediments. The RSL changes that stem from the exchange of mass between the continental ice-sheets and the oceans are not globally uniform. According to the theory of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), the meltwater redistribution is accompanied by solid Earth deformations and perturbation of the gravity field. The GIA signal is a function of the ice-sheets thickness chronology as well as of the solid Earth\u2019s rheology and it strongly depends on the distance with respect to the ice sheets. In the proximity of a fluctuating ice sheet, the RSL changes are opposite in sign and up to one order of magnitude larger than the global average (eustatic). A clear example of this discordance is found in the geological record of the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (~34.0 Ma). The first appearance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), in fact, was accompanied by a regressive phase in the northern hemisphere (~70 m RSL drop, Priabona, North Italy) while sediments were deposited and preserved in the proximity of the AIS margins (Wilkes Land, East Antarctica) in response to a local RSL rise (>100 m) and consequent increase of accommodation space. In this work the contribution of GIA-driven RSL changes in drawing the architecture of stratigraphic sections is investigated by means of a novel numerical modeling approach. The latter consists in the full coupling between a GIA model, which is based on the Sea Level Equation, and two sedimentation models that are based, respectively, on (i) fuzzy logic and on (ii) the numerical solution of the diffusion equation. Among the several variables that regulate marine sedimentation, changes in bathymetry and distance from shore and ice-sheet margin are directly linked to the gravitationally self-consistent RSL changes that are driven by GIA. The latter is also influenced by the load of the sediments that contribute to solid Earth and gravitational perturbations. The proposed algorithm, therefore, handles the biunivocal relationship between RSL changes and sediment loading in a synergistic manner. Preliminary results show that the reconstructed ice-proximal stratigraphic sections, either based on fuzzy logic or diffusion, are significantly affected by the GIA process and that the eustatic approximation should be discarded. This model is proposed as a tool for the geology community.\nDownload attachments:\nWebinar_19_november_2020_stocchi.pdf\nback to top\nRead all News\nBandi e Avvisi\nGraduatoria Geogiglio\nChina Link Scholarship program\nISSNAF programma Mentoring\nCorsi di Laurea\nScienze Geologiche [GEO-L]\nScienze Naturali e Ambientali [NAT-L]\nScienze Ambientali [WSM-LM]\nExploration and Applied Geophysics (MSc) [WGF-LM]\nScienze e Tecnologie Geologiche [WGE-LM]\nGeology [GLY-L] (sede Uzbekistan)\nOrario delle lezioni\nConvenzioni attive per tirocini\nAttivit\u00e0\nArchivio notizie\nArchivio seminari\nBandi e avvisi\nBreve storia del Dipartimento\nEsami di stato\nOrientamento\nLogin\nPer accedere all'Area Risevata ( Verbali, mailing list ecc.) loggarsi le Credenziali di Ateneo\nUsername\nPassword\nDipartimento Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nVia S.

These are responsible for global ocean volume variations that can be extracted from the isotope record and that also show up as relative sea-level (RSL) changes in the geomorphological and stratigraphic records.The consequent bathymetric variations, which result in changes of accommodation space and distance from shore, affect the deposition of marine sediments. The RSL changes that stem from the exchange of mass between the continental ice-sheets and the oceans are not globally uniform. According to the theory of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), the meltwater redistribution is accompanied by solid Earth deformations and perturbation of the gravity field. The GIA signal is a function of the ice-sheets thickness chronology as well as of the solid Earth\u2019s rheology and it strongly depends on the distance with respect to the ice sheets. In the proximity of a fluctuating ice sheet, the RSL changes are opposite in sign and up to one order of magnitude larger than the global average (eustatic). A clear example of this discordance is found in the geological record of the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (~34.0 Ma). The first appearance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), in fact, was accompanied by a regressive phase in the northern hemisphere (~70 m RSL drop, Priabona, North Italy) while sediments were deposited and preserved in the proximity of the AIS margins (Wilkes Land, East Antarctica) in response to a local RSL rise (>100 m) and consequent increase of accommodation space. In this work the contribution of GIA-driven RSL changes in drawing the architecture of stratigraphic sections is investigated by means of a novel numerical modeling approach. The latter consists in the full coupling between a GIA model, which is based on the Sea Level Equation, and two sedimentation models that are based, respectively, on (i) fuzzy logic and on (ii) the numerical solution of the diffusion equation. Among the several variables that regulate marine sedimentation, changes in bathymetry and distance from shore and ice-sheet margin are directly linked to the gravitationally self-consistent RSL changes that are driven by GIA. The latter is also influenced by the load of the sediments that contribute to solid Earth and gravitational perturbations. The proposed algorithm, therefore, handles the biunivocal relationship between RSL changes and sediment loading in a synergistic manner. Preliminary results show that the reconstructed ice-proximal stratigraphic sections, either based on fuzzy logic or diffusion, are significantly affected by the GIA process and that the eustatic approximation should be discarded. This model is proposed as a tool for the geology community.\nDownload attachments:\nWebinar_19_november_2020_stocchi.pdf"}

Willy Tinner University of Bern Institute of Plant Sciences Paleoecology\nMicrosoft Teams\nYouTube\nRiassunto: Legacies comprise human and ecological memories or carryover of the ecosystem, they are effects of past events that influence extant ecosystems. In this seminar, we consider four legacy examples that have wide consequences for European vegetation and its services to the society. Palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic evidence as well as process-based dynamic modelling is used to address the question, whether humans changed the realized climatic niches of species during the past 5,000 years, creating a continental disequilibrium of species distributions with current climatic conditions. We conclude that palaeo-validated, process-based dynamic models have the potential to significantly refine scenarios of future vegetation dynamics under global change conditions.\nWilly Tinner \u00e8 professore ordinario di paleoecologia all'Universit\u00e0 di Berna, co-presidente di PAGES (Past Global Changes), un programma di ricerca globale che coinvolge oltre 5.000 ricercatori.

At the heart of this is a debate about how far we have been slaves to climate, and how far changes in climate have been a stimulus for human innovation. Climatic adversity did not produce the same effect for complex societies as it did for subsistence farmers or hunter-foragers. Whereas hunter-foragers typically exploited a wide array of food resources, giving flexibility in resource procurement, most farming economies relied on a relatively narrow range of crops. They became vulnerable if these staples were threatened by drought, frost, pests or diseases. Perhaps for this reason, a positive correlation is commonly seen between population increase (decline) and favourable (adverse) climatic conditions in Neolithic societies. Researchers have also linked the collapse of subsequent, complex state-based societies to periods of drought, for example during the demise of the Late Bronze Age world system in the eastern Mediterranean. On the other hand, the civilization of ancient Egypt developed despite unfavourable desiccation of the Green Sahara during the mid-Holocene, because the resulting climatic challenge prompted technological and societal innovations, such as irrigation, food storage and redistribution. Although climate-induced food scarcity may have had negative consequences for human populations in the short term, over the long arc of history, climatic change appears to have acted as prompt rather than a barrier to social evolution.\nDownload attachments:\nLocandina_Neil_Roberts_link.pdf\nback to top\nRead all News\nBandi e Avvisi\nGraduatoria Geogiglio\nChina Link Scholarship program\nISSNAF programma Mentoring\nCorsi di Laurea\nScienze Geologiche [GEO-L]\nScienze Naturali e Ambientali [NAT-L]\nScienze Ambientali [WSM-LM]\nExploration and Applied Geophysics (MSc) [WGF-LM]\nScienze e Tecnologie Geologiche [WGE-LM]\nGeology [GLY-L] (sede Uzbekistan)\nOrario delle lezioni\nConvenzioni attive per tirocini\nAttivit\u00e0\nArchivio notizie\nArchivio seminari\nBandi e avvisi\nBreve storia del Dipartimento\nEsami di stato\nOrientamento\nLogin\nPer accedere all'Area Risevata ( Verbali, mailing list ecc.) loggarsi le Credenziali di Ateneo\nUsername\nPassword\nDipartimento Scienze della Terra - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nVia S.
