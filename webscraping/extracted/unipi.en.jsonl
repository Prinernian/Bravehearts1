{"doc_id": "ogbUDBBEey", "title": "The University of Pisa and its history", "description": "The University of Pisa is a public institution with twenty departments, and high level research centres in the agriculture, astrophysics, computer science, engineering, medicine and veterinary medicine sectors. Furthermore the University has close relations with the Pisan Institutes of the National Board of Research, with many cultural institutions of national and international importance, and with industries, especially those based in information technology, which went through a phase of rapid expansion in Pisa during the nineteen sixties and seventies. The University of Pisa was officially established in 1343, although a number of scholars claim its origin dates back to the 11th century. The earliest evidence of a Pisan \"Studium\" dates back to 1338, when the renowned jurist Ranieri Arsendi transferred to Pisa from Bologna. He along with Bartolo Da Sassoferrato, a lecturer in Civil Law, were paid by the Municipality to teach public lessons. The papal bull 'In supremae dignitatis', granted by Pope Clement VI on 3 September 1343, recognized the 'Studium' of Pisa as a 'Studium Generale'; an institution of further education founded or confirmed by a universal authority, the Papacy or Empire. Pisa was one of the first European universities that received this papal attestation, which guaranteed the universal, legal value of its educational qualifications. The subjects taught first were: Theology, Civil Law, Canon Law and Medicine. In 1355 Francesco Da Buti, the well-known commentator of Dante's Divine Comedy, began teaching at the \"Studium\". Pisa and its \"Studium\" underwent a period of crisis around the turn of the 15th century: the Florentines' conquering of the town ruined its economic and social life. However, there is a lack of documented evidence on the University's regular functioning for decades. In 1473, thanks to Lorenzo dei Medici, the Pisan Studium resumed its systematic development and the construction of a building for holding lessons was built in 1486. The building - later known as Palazzo della Sapienza (The Building of Knowledge) - was located in the fourteenth-century Piazza del Grano. The image of a cherub was placed Above the Gate 'Dell'Abbondanza' (the Gate of Abundance), leading to the Piazza, which is still today the symbol of the University. Following the rebellion against Florence in 1494 and the war following, the Pisan Studium suffered a period of decline, and was transferred to Pistoia, Prato and Florence. The ceremonial re-opening of the University, on 1 November 1543, occurred under the rule of Duke Cosimo I dei Medici, who was considered as a second inauguration. The statute of 1545 improved the quality of the University and the Pisan Athenaeum became one of the most notorious in Europe for teaching and research. Luca Ghini held the chair of \"Semplici\" (Botany), and was the founder of the world's first Botanical Gardens, succeeded by Andrea Cesalpino, who pioneered the first scientific methodology for the classification of plants and is considered a forerunner in the discovery of blood circulation. Gabriele Fallopio and Marcello Malpighi lectured in Anatomy and Medicine. Galileo Galilei, who was born and studied in Pisa, became a professor of Mathematics at the Pisan Studium in 1589. The University's role as a state institution became even more noticeable during the Medici Grand Duchy period. A protectionist policy ensured that there were a consistent number of scholars and teachers: laws issued by Cosimo I, Ferdinando I and Ferdinando II obliged those who intended to obtain a degree to attend the Studium of Pisa. This period sees various illustrious figures lecture at Pisa, especially in the field of law and medicine. The University's development continued under the dynasty of Lorenas. They completed the construction of the astronomic observatory (a project initiated by the Medicis), as well as enriching the University Library with important publications, developing the Botanical Gardens and Natural Science Museum and they established new chairs, such as Experimental Physics and Chemistry.\u00a0 The annexation of Tuscany to the Napoleonic Empire resulted in the transformation of the Studium into an Imperial Academy: the Athenaeum became a branch of the University of Paris and the courses and study programs were structured following the French public education model. Five new faculties were established (Theology, Law, Medicine, Science and Literature), along with examinations, different qualification titles and graduation theses. In 1813 'La Scuola Normale Superiore' was established, as a branch of the 'Ecole Normale de Paris'. The Restoration wasn't able to erase the effects of the Napoleonic experience. The first Congress of Italian Scientists was held in Pisa in 1839. 421 scientists and over 300 experts of various disciplines discussed zoology, comparative anatomy, chemistry, physics, mathematics, agronomy, technology, botany, vegetation physiology, geology, mineralogy, geography and medicine. In 1839 - 1840 the Director of Education, Gaetano Giorgini, brought about the most important reform in the University of Pisa by raising the number of faculties to six (Theology, Law, Literature, Medicine, Mathematics and Natural Sciences) and created the world's first chair of Agriculture and sheep farming. In 1846 the Scuola Normale was re-opened. Meanwhile, liberal and patriotic ideals were spreading at Athenaeum and a battalion of the University - composed of lecturers and students - distinguished itself in the Battle of Curtatone and Montanara in 1848. During the 'Second Restoration', in 1851, Leopoldo II united the universities of Pisa and Siena in a unique Etruscan Athenaeum, which was motivated partly by economic reasons, but primarily for political control. The faculties of Theology and Law rested at Siena; while those of Literature, Medicine, Mathematics and Natural Sciences remained at Pisa. Following the Florentine insurrection and the fleeing of the Grand Duke in 1859, one of the initial measures imposed by the Provisory Government was the restitution to the city of Pisa of its Studium with all six of its faculties.\u00a0 With the birth of the Kingdom of Italy, the University of Pisa became one of the new state's most prestigious cultural institutions. Between the second half of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries the following prestigious lecturers taught at Pisa: the lawyers Francesco Carrara and Francesco Buonamici, philologists Domenico Comparetti and Giovanni D'Ancona, historians Pasquale Villari, Gioacchino Volpe and Luigi Russo, philosopher Giovanni Gentile, economist Giuseppe Toniolo and mathematicians Ulisse Dini and Antonio Pacinotti. The first European institute of Historical Linguistics was founded in Pisa in 1890.\u00a0 During the years of fascism the Pisa Athenaeum was an active centre for political debate and antifascist organisation.\u00a0 After the Second World War the University of Pisa returned to the avant-garde in many fields of knowledge. During the 1900s, the University continued to grow and the Engineering and Pharmacy faculties, were established before the war, and then after the Second World War the Economics, Foreign Languages and Literature and Politics faculties were established. In 1967 the 'Scuola Superiore di Studi Universitari e Perfezionamento S.

In 1813 'La\nScuola Normale Superiore\n' was established, as a branch of the 'Ecole Normale de Paris'.\nThe Restoration wasn't able to erase the effects of the Napoleonic experience. The\nfirst Congress of Italian Scientists\nwas held in Pisa in\n1839\n. 421 scientists and over 300 experts of various disciplines discussed zoology, comparative anatomy, chemistry, physics, mathematics, agronomy, technology, botany, vegetation physiology, geology, mineralogy, geography and medicine.\nIn 1839 - 1840 the Director of Education, Gaetano Giorgini, brought about the most important reform in the University of Pisa by raising the number of faculties to six (Theology, Law, Literature, Medicine, Mathematics and Natural Sciences) and created the world's first chair of Agriculture and sheep farming.\nIn 1846 the Scuola Normale was re-opened. Meanwhile,\nliberal and patriotic ideals\nwere spreading at Athenaeum and a battalion of the University - composed of lecturers and students - distinguished itself in the\nBattle of Curtatone and Montanara in 1848\n.\nDuring the 'Second Restoration', in 1851,\nLeopoldo II\nunited the universities of Pisa and Siena in a unique\nEtruscan Athenaeum\n, which was motivated partly by economic reasons, but primarily for political control. The faculties of Theology and Law rested at Siena; while those of Literature, Medicine, Mathematics and Natural Sciences remained at Pisa. Following the Florentine insurrection and the fleeing of the Grand Duke in\n1859\n, one of the initial measures imposed by the Provisory Government was the restitution to the city of Pisa of its Studium with all six of its faculties.\nWith the birth of the\nKingdom of Italy\n, the University of Pisa became one of the\nnew state's most prestigious cultural institutions\n. Between the second half of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries the following prestigious lecturers taught at Pisa: the lawyers\nFrancesco Carrara\nand\nFrancesco Buonamici\n, philologists\nDomenico Comparetti\nand\nGiovanni D'Ancona\n, historians\nPasquale Villari\n,\nGioacchino Volpe\nand\nLuigi Russo\n, philosopher\nGiovanni Gentile\n, economist\nGiuseppe Toniolo\nand mathematicians\nUlisse Dini\nand\nAntonio Pacinotti\n. The\nfirst European institute of Historical Linguistics\nwas founded in Pisa in\n1890\n.\nDuring the years of fascism the Pisa Athenaeum was an active centre for\npolitical debate\nand\nantifascist organisation\n.\nAfter the Second World War the University of Pisa returned to the\navant-garde in many fields of knowledge\n. During the 1900s, the University continued to grow and the Engineering and Pharmacy faculties, were established before the war, and then after the Second World War the Economics, Foreign Languages and Literature and Politics faculties were established. In 1967 the 'Scuola Superiore di Studi Universitari e Perfezionamento S. Anna' was founded which, together with 'La Scuola Normale', formed a highly prestigious learning and teaching centre.\nAllegati:\nAbout Unipi\nD\u00e9pliant\nQuesto sito utilizza solo cookie tecnici, propri e di terze parti, per il corretto funzionamento delle pagine web e per il miglioramento dei servizi.

He graduated in Computer Science at the University of Pisa in 1982 and gained a joint Ph.D. in Information Technology from the Universities of Genoa, Pisa and Udine in 1988. After a period at the Imperial College of Science in London, he returned to the University of Pisa initially as a researcher, then associate professor and finally from 2004 as a full professor in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Paolo Mancarella is married and has two children. Institutional roles During his career, Professor Mancarella has covered numerous important institutional roles both within the University of Pisa and at national level. He was Deputy Head of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences from 2006 to 2010 and Vice Rector to Teaching from 2010 to 2016. From 1999 to 2016, he was the Rector\u2019s Delegate in the function of coordination, supervision and support of all those activities concerning the integration of students with disabilities. He was also Head of the Unit for the support and integration of students with disabilities (USID). Between 2009 and 2015, he was President of the National University Conference for Disability Delegates (CNUDD). Scientific and teaching activities Professor Mancarella\u2019s teaching activities have been mainly within the field of the core learning activities for the degrees in Computer Science and Informatics. He was Head of the Operative Unit of the Department of Computer Science for two regional projects aimed at developing multimedia learning centres and the use of innovative teleformation methodologies for staff training.On the research side, Professor Mancarella started from the analysis of the declarative programming language for knowledge representation.

Leveraging rich administrative data we show that the reform improved students\u2019 first-year outcomes by reducing the probability of dropout and increasing the number of exams passed and credits earned.

Maffeo Pantaleoni\u2019s starting and ending positions on equality of opportunity\"\n.\nRelatore sar\u00e0\nGiacomo Gabbuti\n(Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna).\nAbstract\nMaffeo Pantaleoni\u2019s Nota sui caratteri delle posizioni iniziali e sull\u2019influenza che le posizioni iniziali esercitano sulle terminali (1901) has not yet received specific scholarly attention, especially from the perspective of the intellectual history of inequality. While Maccabelli (2008) had pointed out the importance of Pantaleoni\u2019s discussion of equality of opportunity on both the statistician Rodolfo Benini\u2019s later works on the matter, and most importantly Luigi Einaudi\u2019s Lezioni di politica sociale (Maccabelli, 2012), we still lack a reconstruction of the origins and development of Pantaleoni\u2019s own reflection on the matter \u2013 a radically anti-egalitarian theoretical contribution, fiercely opposing any redistributive policy intervention.\nIn this paper, I reconstruct the starting points of Pantaleoni\u2019s radical views on the matter, by a survey of his earlier works. Then, I place this contribution within the academic and policy milieu of its time (starting from the infamous proposal by Rignano, 1901), to discuss the links with Pantaleoni\u2019s own later policy proposal, the abolition of inheritance taxation (Pantaleoni, 1928). Together with this anti-egalitarian tradition within Italian economics, the paper highlights overlooked debates, involving major Italian and international economists, on inequality and redistribution, against conventional narratives on its \u201cdisappearance\u201d after the classics.\nInfo e Contatti:\nFrancesca Dal Degan\nfrancesca.daldegan@unipi.it\nhttps://www.ec.unipi.it/eventi/giacomo-gabbuti-scuola-superiore-santanna-pisa-where-is-merit-maffeo-pantaleonis-starting-and-ending-positions-on-equality-of-opportunity/\n2024-07-02 11:00:00\n2024-07-02 13:00:00\nQuesto sito utilizza solo cookie tecnici, propri e di terze parti, per il corretto funzionamento delle pagine web e per il miglioramento dei servizi.

{"doc_id": "RQ3HpUjHqX", "title": "Walter Salvatore - Vice Rector for Construction", "description": "Walter SalvatoreProfessor of Construction Techniques at the Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering. Walter Salvatore was born in Nard\u00f2 (Lecce) in 1966. He graduated in Civil Engineering from the University of Pisa in 1993 and gained a joint Ph.D. in Structural Engineering from the Universities of Florence, Bari, Genoa, Pisa and Udine in 1997. He was a researcher at the University of Pisa from 2002 and an associate professor there from 2011 to 2016 when he became a full professor. Incarichi istituzionali Since 2015 Professor Salvatore has been the president of the Joint Council for the Interclass Master\u2019s degree in Building and Structural Engineering and for the Master\u2019s degree in Hydraulic, Transportation and Territory Engineering. He has participated and continues to participate as an expert member in committees set up by the Superior Council of Public Works of the Ministry of Infrastructure for the drafting of technical regulations for anti-seismic construction design, the guidelines for the seismic classification of buildings and the reduction of seismic risk and the guidelines for the anti-seismic design of metallic structures. Attivit\u00e0 didattica e scientifica Professor Salvatore holds courses in Construction in Earthquake-prone Areas and Foundation Structures for the Interclass Master\u2019s Degree in Building and Structural Engineering of the University of Pisa and in Construction Techniques for the Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Civil, Environmental and Building Engineering.Professor Salvatore\u2019s research interests are in the field of anti-seismic construction and the reduction of seismic risk. In this field, he has elaborated on the subject of the design in steel and steel-concrete composite structures, developing structural systems for the dissipation of seismic energy. In the field of reinforced concrete structures, he is studying the development of Dual-Phase steel reinforcing bars for enhancing the capacity and durability of these structures. He has also faced the problems of the static safety and the seismic vulnerability of existing structures in stone and reinforced concrete as well as historic buildings, studying, therefore, techniques and intervention strategies to remediate their seismic deficiencies. Finally, he has recently collaborated on the development of new methodologies for the assessment of seismic risk of structures, based on a macroseismic approach, calibrated together with the Tuscan Region and that of Emilia Romagna.At international level, Professor Salvatore is the coordinator of four research projects financed at European level. He was the principal investigator of the research unit at the University of Pisa for a further 12 international research projects; he was also the principal investigator of the research unit at the University of Pisa for five national research projects and more than 40 research contracts stipulated with public authorities and private enterprises.

She was admitted as an avvocato in Italy in 2002 and admitted as a cassazionista (Supreme Court lawyer) in 2008. In 2007, she joined the Department of Law as an associate professor, working both in the doctoral school in \u201cLegal Studies\u201d and in the didactic organization of the post-graduate course in \u201cEconomic Law and Public Manager\u201d (GEMP). Within the legal profession, she has dealt with legal affairs in the sphere of her scientific interests: Energy, public procurement, subsidiary companies, local public services, complex urban renewal projects and state aid.Professor Michela Passalacqua is married and lives in Sarzana. \u00a0 Institutional roles Since 2015, she has been the director of the post-graduate course in Economic Law and Public Manager, created by the Department of Law of the University of Pisa.

She is the author of two monographs on the subject of public supervision of company activity and over sixty publications. Her first book deals with administrative inspections: it presents a possible typification, in order to reconstruct the relationship with the function and highlights the often precautional and in particular discretional nature, and it illustrates the contradictions that positive law presents on the subject of the guarantee and safeguard of the private individuals inspected. The second monograph is a marked criticism of the present model of public regulation of financial markets, uncovering alternative and more efficient means, capable of enhancing what the conservative regulations have always ignored, but which instead are a typical element of today\u2019s banking and financial markets: uncertainty. In these terms, rules following the principals of precaution are identified, where the level of public intervention is graded according to the differing level of uncertainty linked to the activity regulated. Further research interests are mainly in public finance law, and more specifically in the process of expense revision and its effect on the managerial phase of public services; the structure and discipline of state-controlled companies; the relationship between law, economics and public interest.

He graduated in Biological Sciences in 1988 and gained his Ph.D. in Marine Ecology in 1993. He carried out postdoctoral research from 1994 to 1998 under European Community projects and from 1995 to 1998 he was Contract Professor at the University of Urbino. Since 1998, he has been academic member of the University of Pisa, firstly as a researcher (1998-2005), then as an associate professor (2005-2015) and finally as a full professor of Ecology (from 2015). Professor Lisandro Benedetti Cecchi is married and has two children. Institutional roles During the course of his career, Professor Lisandro Benedetti Cecchi has covered numerous roles both at national and international level. From 2004 to 2009 he represented the University of Pisa in the Network of excellence MARBEF (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning), funded by the European Union under the Sixth Framework Programme. From 2006 to 2009, he was a member of the Review panel of the European Science Foundation and since 2011 he is member of the LS8 panel of the IDEAS Programme of the European Research Council (Starting and Consolidator Grants).

Scientific and teaching activities Lisandro Benedetti Cecchi\u2019s research interests focuse mainly on the ecology of marine coastal environments; is has published over 200 scientific papers, more than half of which in peer-reviewed, international indexed journals. His research uses marine coastal plants and animals as model systems to address fundamental ecological and biological questions, including the analysis of processes that generate patterns at multiple scales, the causes and consequences of loss of biodiversity and the impact of climate change on marine coastal ecosystems. One of the main goals of this research is to provide experimental tests of theories that have been rarely examined in the field such as the role of environmental variance in shaping the spatial and temporal structure of natural communities and the experimental test of early warning signals of regime shift in complex systems.Professor Benedetti Cecchi has coordinated both national and international projects. From 2005 to 2010, he was the European Coordinator of NaGISA (Natural Geography of Inshore Areas), a project of the Census of Marine Life aimed at investigating patterns of marine coastal biodiversity at large spatial and temporal scales. From 2008 to 2010, he was the national coordinator of the PRIN project: The Resilience of Coastal Biodiversity to Synergistic Effects of Global and Local Environmental Changes (BIORES). He has also been the principal investigator in numerous other European projects under the FP5, FP6 and FP7 programmes. During the course of his career Professor Benedetti Cecchi has also given more than 30 seminars and invited talks at some of the most important research institutes (among which the Anton Dohrn Zoological Station in Naples and MIT) and at national and international conferences. He has been a member of the editorial committee of four international journals (\"Marine Ecology Progress Series\", \"Estuaries and Coasts\", \"Phycologia\" and \"Marine Ecology\") and is still serving as contributing editor in the first of these. In June 2016, he organized the XI International Temperate Reef Symposium, Pisa, the most important international conference on the ecology of rocky coasts.

Walter Salvatore was born in Nard\u00f2 (Lecce) in 1966. He graduated in Civil Engineering from the University of Pisa in 1993 and gained a joint Ph.D. in Structural Engineering from the Universities of Florence, Bari, Genoa, Pisa and Udine in 1997. He was a researcher at the University of Pisa from 2002 and an associate professor there from 2011 to 2016 when he became a full professor. Incarichi istituzionali Since 2015 Professor Salvatore has been the president of the Joint Council for the Interclass Master\u2019s degree in Building and Structural Engineering and for the Master\u2019s degree in Hydraulic, Transportation and Territory Engineering. He has participated and continues to participate as an expert member in committees set up by the Superior Council of Public Works of the Ministry of Infrastructure for the drafting of technical regulations for anti-seismic construction design, the guidelines for the seismic classification of buildings and the reduction of seismic risk and the guidelines for the anti-seismic design of metallic structures. Attivit\u00e0 didattica e scientifica Professor Salvatore holds courses in Construction in Earthquake-prone Areas and Foundation Structures for the Interclass Master\u2019s Degree in Building and Structural Engineering of the University of Pisa and in Construction Techniques for the Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Civil, Environmental and Building Engineering.Professor Salvatore\u2019s research interests are in the field of anti-seismic construction and the reduction of seismic risk. In this field, he has elaborated on the subject of the design in steel and steel-concrete composite structures, developing structural systems for the dissipation of seismic energy. In the field of reinforced concrete structures, he is studying the development of Dual-Phase steel reinforcing bars for enhancing the capacity and durability of these structures. He has also faced the problems of the static safety and the seismic vulnerability of existing structures in stone and reinforced concrete as well as historic buildings, studying, therefore, techniques and intervention strategies to remediate their seismic deficiencies. Finally, he has recently collaborated on the development of new methodologies for the assessment of seismic risk of structures, based on a macroseismic approach, calibrated together with the Tuscan Region and that of Emilia Romagna.At international level, Professor Salvatore is the coordinator of four research projects financed at European level. He was the principal investigator of the research unit at the University of Pisa for a further 12 international research projects; he was also the principal investigator of the research unit at the University of Pisa for five national research projects and more than 40 research contracts stipulated with public authorities and private enterprises. He has supervised and continues to supervise research projects as an independent expert at national and international level. In particular, since 2006, he has been an independent expert member, nominated by the Research Directorate-General, Directorate G \u2013 Industrial Technologies of the European Commission, for the assessment and monitoring of research projects financed by the RFCS: Research Fund for Coal and Steel and the ECSC: European Committee for Coal and Steel.

Finally, he has recently collaborated on the development of new methodologies for the assessment of seismic risk of structures, based on a macroseismic approach, calibrated together with the Tuscan Region and that of Emilia Romagna.\nAt international level, Professor Salvatore is the coordinator of four research projects financed at European level. He was the principal investigator of the research unit at the University of Pisa for a further 12 international research projects; he was also the principal investigator of the research unit at the University of Pisa for five national research projects and more than 40 research contracts stipulated with public authorities and private enterprises. He has supervised and continues to supervise research projects as an independent expert at national and international level. In particular, since 2006, he has been an independent expert member, nominated by the Research Directorate-General, Directorate G \u2013 Industrial Technologies of the European Commission, for the assessment and monitoring of research projects financed by the RFCS: Research Fund for Coal and Steel and the ECSC: European Committee for Coal and Steel.\nContacts\nSegreteria dei Prorettori\nPalazzo Alla Giornata, Lungarno Pacinotti 43 - 56100 Pisa\ntel. +39 050 2212591 - fax +39 050 2212305\ne-mail:\nQuesto indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo.\nUltima modifica:\nGio 22 Nov 2018 - 07:54\nNews\nLucia Arcarisi e la sua startup Weabios tra i protagonisti del premio Woman Value Company 2024\nScoperti i pi\u00f9 antichi antenati del bue domestico\nAd Anna Ethelwyn Baccaglini-Frank il premio Montessori-Margreth dei Lincei\nSeguici su\nUniversit\u00e0 di Pisa\nLungarno Pacinotti 43\n56126 Pisa\nP.I. 00286820501\nC.F. 80003670504\nCentralino\nTel +39 050 221 2111\nFax +39 050 40834\nNumero Verde Studenti\u00a0800018600\nPosta Elettronica Certificata Ateneo\nContatti\nUnimap - Cerca Persone\nCrediti\nPrivacy Policy\nNote legali\nElenco siti tematici\nUrp\nAccessibilit\u00e0\nAmministrazione trasparente\nAtti di notifica\nAlbo ufficiale\nCodice etico\nQuesto sito utilizza solo cookie tecnici, propri e di terze parti, per il corretto funzionamento delle pagine web e per il miglioramento dei servizi.

He graduated in Biological Sciences in 1988 and gained his Ph.D. in Marine Ecology in 1993. He carried out postdoctoral research from 1994 to 1998 under European Community projects and from 1995 to 1998 he was Contract Professor at the University of Urbino. Since 1998, he has been academic member of the University of Pisa, firstly as a researcher (1998-2005), then as an associate professor (2005-2015) and finally as a full professor of Ecology (from 2015). Professor Lisandro Benedetti Cecchi is married and has two children. Institutional roles During the course of his career, Professor Lisandro Benedetti Cecchi has covered numerous roles both at national and international level. From 2004 to 2009 he represented the University of Pisa in the Network of excellence MARBEF (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning), funded by the European Union under the Sixth Framework Programme. From 2006 to 2009, he was a member of the Review panel of the European Science Foundation and since 2011 he is member of the LS8 panel of the IDEAS Programme of the European Research Council (Starting and Consolidator Grants). From 2009 to 2012, he was Deputy Director of the Department of Biology. He is a member of the Ecology and Biology Panel of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) since 2015 and since 2016 has represented the National Interuniversity Consortium for Marine Sciences (CoNISMa) of the \"University Consortia Panel\" of the European Marine Board.

Scientific and teaching activities Lisandro Benedetti Cecchi\u2019s research interests focuse mainly on the ecology of marine coastal environments; is has published over 200 scientific papers, more than half of which in peer-reviewed, international indexed journals. His research uses marine coastal plants and animals as model systems to address fundamental ecological and biological questions, including the analysis of processes that generate patterns at multiple scales, the causes and consequences of loss of biodiversity and the impact of climate change on marine coastal ecosystems. One of the main goals of this research is to provide experimental tests of theories that have been rarely examined in the field such as the role of environmental variance in shaping the spatial and temporal structure of natural communities and the experimental test of early warning signals of regime shift in complex systems.Professor Benedetti Cecchi has coordinated both national and international projects. From 2005 to 2010, he was the European Coordinator of NaGISA (Natural Geography of Inshore Areas), a project of the Census of Marine Life aimed at investigating patterns of marine coastal biodiversity at large spatial and temporal scales. From 2008 to 2010, he was the national coordinator of the PRIN project: The Resilience of Coastal Biodiversity to Synergistic Effects of Global and Local Environmental Changes (BIORES). He has also been the principal investigator in numerous other European projects under the FP5, FP6 and FP7 programmes. During the course of his career Professor Benedetti Cecchi has also given more than 30 seminars and invited talks at some of the most important research institutes (among which the Anton Dohrn Zoological Station in Naples and MIT) and at national and international conferences. He has been a member of the editorial committee of four international journals (\"Marine Ecology Progress Series\", \"Estuaries and Coasts\", \"Phycologia\" and \"Marine Ecology\") and is still serving as contributing editor in the first of these.

{"doc_id": "UqhFaGfYNB", "title": "Paolo Maria Mancarella - Rector 2016-2022", "description": "Paolo Maria MancarellaProfessor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Scienceemail: Questo indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo. // Paolo Mancarella was born in Gallarate (Varese) on 8th November 1959. He graduated in Computer Science at the University of Pisa in 1982 and gained a joint Ph.D. in Information Technology from the Universities of Genoa, Pisa and Udine in 1988. After a period at the Imperial College of Science in London, he returned to the University of Pisa initially as a researcher, then associate professor and finally from 2004 as a full professor in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Paolo Mancarella is married and has two children. Institutional roles During his career, Professor Mancarella has covered numerous important institutional roles both within the University of Pisa and at national level. He was Deputy Head of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences from 2006 to 2010 and Vice Rector to Teaching from 2010 to 2016. From 1999 to 2016, he was the Rector\u2019s Delegate in the function of coordination, supervision and support of all those activities concerning the integration of students with disabilities. He was also Head of the Unit for the support and integration of students with disabilities (USID). Between 2009 and 2015, he was President of the National University Conference for Disability Delegates (CNUDD). Scientific and teaching activities Professor Mancarella\u2019s teaching activities have been mainly within the field of the core learning activities for the degrees in Computer Science and Informatics. He was Head of the Operative Unit of the Department of Computer Science for two regional projects aimed at developing multimedia learning centres and the use of innovative teleformation methodologies for staff training.On the research side, Professor Mancarella started from the analysis of the declarative programming language for knowledge representation. He then expanded his interest to the broader theme of computational logic, studying innovative models and language for intelligent systems based on logic, able to endow artificial systems with a capacity for reasoning which is not only deductive but also hypothetical and predictive.

He graduated in Computer Science at the University of Pisa in 1982 and gained a joint Ph.D. in Information Technology from the Universities of Genoa, Pisa and Udine in 1988. After a period at the Imperial College of Science in London, he returned to the University of Pisa initially as a researcher, then associate professor and finally from 2004 as a full professor in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Paolo Mancarella is married and has two children.\nInstitutional roles\nDuring his career, Professor Mancarella has covered numerous important institutional roles both within the University of Pisa and at national level. He was Deputy Head of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences from 2006 to 2010 and Vice Rector to Teaching from 2010 to 2016. From 1999 to 2016, he was the Rector\u2019s Delegate in the function of coordination, supervision and support of all those activities concerning the integration of students with disabilities. He was also Head of the Unit for the support and integration of students with disabilities (USID). Between 2009 and 2015, he was President of the National University Conference for Disability Delegates (CNUDD).\nScientific and teaching activities\nProfessor Mancarella\u2019s teaching activities have been mainly within the field of the core learning activities for the degrees in Computer Science and Informatics. He was Head of the Operative Unit of the Department of Computer Science for two regional projects aimed at developing multimedia learning centres and the use of innovative teleformation methodologies for staff training.\nOn the research side, Professor Mancarella started from the analysis of the declarative programming language for knowledge representation. He then expanded his interest to the broader theme of computational logic, studying innovative models and language for intelligent systems based on logic, able to endow artificial systems with a capacity for reasoning which is not only deductive but also hypothetical and predictive. In more recent years, his research has been aimed at the so-called logic-based argumentation systems through studies of a theoretical and foundational nature, but with an emphasis still on the computational and applicative aspects. These were central themes in two European projects: SOCS (SOcieties of ComputeeS, 5TH Framework Program, 2002-2004) and ARGUGRID (ARGUmentation as a foundation for the semantic GRID, 6th Framework Program, 2006-2009).\nOther research themes developed by Paolo Mancarella are concerned with the static analysis of concurrent languages, temporal reasoning, the integration of functional and logic programming paradigms and the development of prediction systems for people with disabilities.\nContacts\nSegreteria del Rettore\nPalazzo Alla Giornata, Lungarno Pacinotti 43 - 56100 Pisa\ntel. +39 050 2212175 - fax +39 050 42446\ne-mail:\nQuesto indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo.\nRelated topics\nI rettori dell'Universit\u00e0 di Pisa\nUltima modifica:\nGio 05 Gen 2023 - 09:52\nNews\nLucia Arcarisi e la sua startup Weabios tra i protagonisti del premio Woman Value Company 2024\nScoperti i pi\u00f9 antichi antenati del bue domestico\nAd Anna Ethelwyn Baccaglini-Frank il premio Montessori-Margreth dei Lincei\nSeguici su\nUniversit\u00e0 di Pisa\nLungarno Pacinotti 43\n56126 Pisa\nP.I. 00286820501\nC.F. 80003670504\nCentralino\nTel +39 050 221 2111\nFax +39 050 40834\nNumero Verde Studenti\u00a0800018600\nPosta Elettronica Certificata Ateneo\nContatti\nUnimap - Cerca Persone\nCrediti\nPrivacy Policy\nNote legali\nElenco siti tematici\nUrp\nAccessibilit\u00e0\nAmministrazione trasparente\nAtti di notifica\nAlbo ufficiale\nCodice etico\nQuesto sito utilizza solo cookie tecnici, propri e di terze parti, per il corretto funzionamento delle pagine web e per il miglioramento dei servizi.

The project is part of UNIPI internationalisation strategy and it contributed to educational and research goals pursuits of students and faculty members of the universities involved.The 2018 project involved 21 higher education institutions in 9 countries.The University of Novi Sad UNS (Serbia) from the Western Balkans was a partner in Credit Mobility (ICM) since the first call. The current project, like the previous ones, has had very positive results, allowing UNS to reach the internationalisation levels set at the national level by the Strategy of Educational Development. The two Albanian universities, Albanian University of Tirana and University of Tirana, joined the project in order to consolidate the partnership with UNIPI at the educational and scientific level.The KA107 project assesses UNIPI commitment to the building up of the Central Asia Higher Education Area, along the same lines of the European. One of the Central Asia partner is Kyrgyzstan with its universities International University of Kyrgyz Republic IUK and Naryn State University NSU, again project partners since the first call, thanks to which they were able to become leaders in ICM and acquire the practical knowledge to apply Bologna process and quality in higher education principles; another Central Asia partner is Tajikistan, where the partnership involved three universities: Tajik State University of Commerce TSUC, Khatlon State Medical University KHSMU and the Institute of Economy and Trade IET TSUC. Tajik universities see the partnerships offered by KA107 programme as an opportunity to improve students and teaching staff training, which will have a positive impact on the modernisation of higher education. TSUC improved its position in national rankings from sixth to third place. KHSMU and IET TSUC were taking part in the programme for the first time, the first one with staff mobility only, with the aim of improving the health curricula in order to increase competitiveness on national and international scene, considering its young establishment that dates back to 2016; IET TSUC intends to use individual mobility to achieve the level of internationalisation envisaged by the \"Strategic directions for improving the competitiveness of HEIs\".Four universities of the Russian Federation have taken part in the project: Saint Petersburg State University SPbU; State Higher Educational Institution People's friendship University of Russia RUDN, The Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration RANEPA, Moscow State Institute of International Relations MGIMO.

The primary objective of the Moroccan universities is to develop teaching and research internationalization; moreover, they have adopted the ECTS system. With this project, the Tunisian universities wanted to strengthen cooperation with the University of Pisa in various fields: UCAR in rural engineering, UTM in biotechnology and UNIV-K in business and management.As far as Canada is concerned, University of Calgary UCalgary and York University YU were involved to strengthen collaboration with UNIPI in biology and computer studies. From Ethiopia, Samara University SU, in its second project with UNIPI, has focused on staff mobility to improve quality of its teaching and attract students from the rest of the country.66.67% of the mobilities were completed. The outbreak of COVID-19 that gradually spread around the world heavily influenced the development of the project activities, generating a strong decrease in the number of mobilities implemented. Incoming staff mobilities were the most affected, with nearly all planned event cancelled, while outgoing staff mobilities \u2012 though some of them was also cancelled \u2012 had major spin-offs in science and teaching.

Yes you can, provided your sending institution agrees. The University of Pisa is currently offering all its courses on distance learning mode. In case you need further details on the classes you are attending, you can also arrange distance- meetings with your teachers. Although unpredictable being the time, we hope that the summer exams session will take place in presence. We warmly recommend you to plan with your teachers the exam session mode. 2. While attending my courses on distance learning mode, will my Erasmus grant be preserved? Yes, it will. The European Commission recently resolved that the Erasmus grants will be preserved even if students are attending their courses on distance learning mode (https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/resources/coronavirus-impact_en).

Kazakhstan (Al Farabi Kazakh National University AFKNU, International University of Information Technology IITU), Kyrgyzstan (International University of Kyrgyz Republic IUKR, S Naamatov Naryn State UniversityNSU) and Tajikistan(Tajik State University of Commerce TSUC) belong to Central Asia area. IITU, IUKR, NSU,TSUC have increased the mobility flows started in the frame of the Tempus CAHEA project and the previous KA107 projects. AFKNU intends to use international credit mobility (ICM) to reach the level of internationalization envisaged by the Kazakhstan-2050 Strategy. All the flows requested for Central Asia area have been realized.Egypt (Alexandria University AU),Morocco (Cadi Ayyad University UCA, Hassan II University of Casablanca UH2C) and Tunisia(Carthage University UCAR) belong to the southern Mediterranean area. One of the primary objectives of the universities of Morocco is the internationalization of teaching and research. Indeed, they are the ones in the area that are adopting the ECTS system. UCAR participates for the first time in the programme, with staff mobility only, to start a collaboration with UNIPI in the fields of rural engineering and microbiology.Novi Sad University UNS (Serbia) has long been committed to the ICM.The project with UNIPI is aimed at increasing the already numerous mobilities, which are currently being carried out also with other European universities. Samara University SU (Ethiopia) is a young institution that focuses on staff mobility to improve the quality of teaching and attract students from all over the country.The Tblisi Medical State University TSMU is a university with a strong international mark.The cooperation with UNIPI is part of the strategy to strengthen relations with Europe.96% of the mobilities was completed. Incoming and outgoing staff mobilities were carried out with all partner institutions, even more than expected. Staff mobility had a relevant impact, above all in the scientific and institutional fields, as a prerequisite to start or strength joint research and cooperation projects, and collaboration agreements on educational issues.The mobility for study mainly concerned the third and partly the second cycle. More than half of the students conducted research activities at UNIPI with the aim of developing a PhD thesis.This allowed them to learn a research methodology, which they often do not develop in their countries because of the lack of resources and research infrastructures.Moreover, since they are also lecturer and at the same time PhD students,they updated their teaching approach.As they will be the future ruling class,the increase and diversification of skills will have a long lasting, though not immediately measurable, impact in these countries.

More than half of the students conducted research activities at UNIPI with the aim of developing a PhD thesis.This allowed them to learn a research methodology, which they often do not develop in their countries because of the lack of resources and research infrastructures.Moreover, since they are also lecturer and at the same time PhD students,they updated their teaching approach.As they will be the future ruling class,the increase and diversification of skills will have a long lasting, though not immediately measurable, impact in these countries.\nCoordinator:\nUNIVERSIT\u00c0 DI PISA\u00a0 (Italy)\nStart date:\n01-06-2017\nEnd date:\n31-07-2019\nEU Grant:\n314.702\u00a0\u20ac\nProject website:\nhttp://erasmuspluska107.unipi.it/\nUltima modifica:\nVen 12 Gen 2024 - 09:53\nQuesto sito utilizza solo cookie tecnici, propri e di terze parti, per il corretto funzionamento delle pagine web e per il miglioramento dei servizi.

Different types of institutions were chosen in order to meet students\u2019 needs, among which are the following:- universities and research centres (for students wishing to carry out either thesis work or research activities during job placement)- language schools and translation and interpretation agencies- small and medium-size manufacturing enterprises- public bodies- chambers of commerce- hospitals- local and governmental institutions- large companies- associations, foundations and NGOs- architectural firms- museums and libraries- law firms- tourism enterprises- consultancy firms- schools of different levels of education.As far as the goals of specific traineeships are concerned, participants have generally acquired the relevant skills. In particular, they have had the possibility to acquire or further develop:- key competences such as e-skills, entrepreneurship, critical thinking and problem solving- hard skills with reference to their field of study and the use of foreign languages at work- soft skills such as promoting business relationships with enterprises, institutions and associations outside their own country, creating networks, debating, public speaking, mediating and negotiating, synthesizing information and accommodating conflicting interests.As far as recognition is concerned, then, results are equally satisfactory: although the process is still ongoing for mobility periods ending in September, the vast majority of students has so far obtained credit recognition for their traineeship mobility.Funding has been distributed among the six participating universities based on the requests of each of them. Every single university has played a pivotal role and has contributed to the project by performing key functions and carrying out core activities through its own office responsible for the implementation of Erasmus+ traineeship projects.

{"doc_id": "6mNSLp3GHj", "title": "KA103 2016", "description": "Higher education student and staff mobility project (2016) Unipi Team Leader: Francesco Marcelloni,\u00a0Vice-Rector for International Cooperation and Relations The University of Pisa (UNIPI) aims at expanding it's internationalization policy in both qualitative and quantitative terms.Key partnerships have been established, some of which directy coordinated by the University of Pisa.Thanks to the signing of bilateral agreements, the university has built a network of trusted Erasmus partners representing all eligible countries. This network is a result of the extension to new teaching areas of the existing agreements yielding positive results of interest to students.Furthermore, the University of Pisa has increased its presence in the Erasmus + Mobility programme with its well-established participation in the Consorzio Traineeship (Traineeship Consortium), coordinated by the University of Padua.The university has established tactics aimed at encouraging mobility and enabling an ever increasing number of students to make the most of the opportunities offered by the Erasmus + programme.For this purpose, the university has allocated a budget to co-finance the EU Erasmus funding and to integrate it, and it has created a Portal for both incoming and outgoing Erasmus students (ErasmusManager). This is intended to facilitate the mobility-related procedures for students, for the professors coordinating internationalisation (CAI) and for the administrative staff who deal with mobility.As for the number of participants, we have effected a total of 743 student mobilities (for both study and traineeship purposes), 38% of which are traineeships. Indeed, this type of mobility has prompted an 11% increase in traineeship mobility compared to the previous year.In addition, in order to support the mobility of students with special needs, a special service has been set up, in collaboration with the Services Unit dedicated to the integration of students with disabilities \u2013 USID. This provides these students with a personalised support system according to their specific needs, including the filling out of their application for ad hoc EU funding.As part of its policy to promote the integration of refugees in the education and training system, throughout the academic year 2016/2017 the university applied for and obtained 5 OLS licenses, which were assigned to several students singled out through collaboration with the local Italian Red Cross. A special meeting was organized with refugees and Red Cross volunteers to illustrate the opportunity of language learning offered by the university through the OLS.

Through the research work carried out in particular by the labour market Observatory of the University of Padua, we are able to understand better these needs and one of the key demands by companies is to have graduates able to work in international contexts, able to work using foreign languages and to network also at a transnational level.The project addressed students of all the disciplines with a greater attention to students in social, political sciences and humanities, who usually encounter more difficulties in entering the world of work and need to have in their curriculum some qualified international traineeship experiences, to increase their employability.During the academic year 2016/17 the Consortium organised 219 traineeship mobilities, and 185 were funded with Erasmus funds.The traineeships have had an average duration of three months and 17 days and took place mainly in hosting partners such as: language schools, law firms, consultancy firms, local bodies, corporations, banks, chambers of Commerce, international foundations, museums, libraries, NGOs, research institutes and universities.Hosting partners were 195 in 25 different countries. 69 participants were recent graduates.Most of the participants considered that the training activities were relevant and in line with their educational programme and would work in the hosting organization if they had the chance. Almost all participants are satisfied with the mobility experience.More than half of the participants said they could not face the mobility experience without the grant, and this gives an idea of the importance of the program for the students, for the enrichment of their training path and for the fundamental contribution that the program gives to internationalization of curricula.As for the qualitative objectives of internships, participants generally have acquired the skills and competencies that had been foreseen in the learning agreements.The skills were those required by companies working in a globalised context: skills related to the use of foreign languages in the workplace, hard skills related to the study course, but above all soft skills such as communication, networking, problem-solving skills.By analyzing the participants report we can see that more than 90% of the participants thinks their problem solving skills are improved, they have learned better how to plan and carry out their learning independently, learned better how to see the value of different cultures, they are more able to cooperate with people from other backgrounds and cultures, and they know better their strengths and weaknesses. The majority of the participants found that their language proficiency in a foreign language has improved during the mobility.The absolute majority of participants believe that they will have more opportunities to find a job after the mobility, they have clearer ideas about their professional goals, and almost all participants would like to work in an international environment.

Each University contributes with functions and key activities in the project through the office that is responsible for the implementation of the Erasmus for traineeship program.Each University with the coordination and supervision of the University of Padua, has organized and managed its\u00a0own selection, managed relations with its partners, monitored traineeships and ensured full recognition of\u00a0mobilities.During the academic year 2015/16 the Consortium organised 245 traineeship mobilities, 149 were funded with Erasmus funds and the other with national funds. In the previous year 177 mobilities were carried out. This\u00a0increase is due to the widespread publicity and dissemination made by the Universities towards its students, teachers and potential European partners.\u00a0The traineeships have had an average duration of three months and 15 days. More than 470 months have been\u00a0financed by Erasmus funds and 862 months of traineeship have been carried out by the beneficiaries.\u00a0Hosting partners were 241 in 26 different countries.The internships took place mainly in hosting partners such as: language schools, law firms, consultancy firms,\u00a0local bodies, corporations, banks, chambers of Commerce, international foundations, museums, libraries, NGOs,\u00a0research institutes and universities.\u00a0The majority of the participants considered that the training activities were relevant and in line with its educational programme and was satisfied with the mobility experience. They found also that the language proficiency in a foreign language have improved during their mobility.As for the qualitative objectives of internships, participants generally have acquired the skills and competencies that had been foreseen in the learning agreements. The skills were those required by companies working in a globalised context: skills related to the use of foreign languages in the workplace, hard skills related to the study course, but above all soft skills such as communication, networking, problem-solving skills.\u00a0By analyzing the participant reports and hosting institutions evaluations, we can see that participants could benefit from an overall strengthening of employability and of their career prospects because of the improvement or acquisition of hard, soft and language skills, and through increased proactivity, sense of initiative and intercultural awareness.

Each University contributes with functions and key activities in the project through the office that is responsible for the implementation of the Erasmus for traineeship program.Each University with the coordination and supervision of the University of Padua, has organized and managed its\u00a0own selection, managed relations with its partners, monitored traineeships and ensured full recognition of\u00a0mobilities.During the academic year 2015/16 the Consortium organised 245 traineeship mobilities, 149 were funded with Erasmus funds and the other with national funds. In the previous year 177 mobilities were carried out. This\u00a0increase is due to the widespread publicity and dissemination made by the Universities towards its students, teachers and potential European partners.\u00a0The traineeships have had an average duration of three months and 15 days. More than 470 months have been\u00a0financed by Erasmus funds and 862 months of traineeship have been carried out by the beneficiaries.\u00a0Hosting partners were 241 in 26 different countries.The internships took place mainly in hosting partners such as: language schools, law firms, consultancy firms,\u00a0local bodies, corporations, banks, chambers of Commerce, international foundations, museums, libraries, NGOs,\u00a0research institutes and universities.\u00a0The majority of the participants considered that the training activities were relevant and in line with its educational programme and was satisfied with the mobility experience. They found also that the language proficiency in a foreign language have improved during their mobility.As for the qualitative objectives of internships, participants generally have acquired the skills and competencies that had been foreseen in the learning agreements.

{"doc_id": "Xuz4n6EZJU", "title": "Renowacja", "description": "przywracanie \u017cycia zabytkom In our project \u201eRenovation \u2013 bringing monuments to life\u201d took part 20 students of Comprehensive Schools of Building and Construction in Gda\u0144sk. These students acquire knowledge in professions such as technician of restoration of architectural elements and technician of wood technology.The appointed students took part in a two-week placement (apprenticeship), which was held in Pisa (Italy). These students worked on the project in laboratories of the Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department, University of Pisa and participated in restoration of frescoes in Campo Santo, which allowed to get to know modern research methods of wood and familiarization with the techniques of restoration at the highest level.The project lasted from 01.06.2017 to 31.05.2019. The project partner was Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department, University of Pisa.Our project fitted very well in the European growth strategy \u2018Europa 2020\u2019, and it is also consistent with the educational policy of our province, city and school. Taking into consideration the growing importance of youth\u2019s mobility flow and the care of vocational education, we were undertaking actions which encouraged students to cooperate with foreign partners. The aim of the project was to support students in acquiring professional and social competences through getting familiar with new technologies related with renovation of monuments and to strengthen both multicultural bonds and to respect mutually completed work. Thanks to the participation in this project our teachers got familiar with one of the European technical languages well enough to enable basic communication. Moreover, another aim of the project was to raise the European dimension of vocational school through starting cooperation with foreign job market and the institutions of higher education. The teachers who took part in the project together with the students, gained additional experience in setting and realising practical trainings in restoration of architectural elements and properties of wood using the latest techniques, and in particular the knowledge of innovative solutions for maintenance of monuments.Our students, by gaining their first professional experience abroad, increased their knowledge, qualifications essential in their profession skills, which are directly related with new techniques used in the restoration, knowledge of innovative solutions applied to study properties of wood and practical skills of conservation usage.Methodology used for project purposes consisted of few stages which played an important part and also determined the project\u2019s success. Methodology embraced all the actions undertaken by the project partners, namely, activities that enabled the participants for mobility, attractive practical trainings, professional and cultural trips as well as monitoring evaluation and dissemination. Completing practical trainings in renovation in Italy let our students become familiar with solutions met in renovator\u2019s and wood technologist\u2019s work other than the ones in Poland. As for social competences, our students learned from each other. They practiced also the ability to cooperate and to share gained knowledge. It had and will have its impact on limiting the number of students finishing their education too early. The direct results also involved knowledge of tradition, history, culture and Italian architecture. It will later become the sense of the European togetherness. The long-term results will be tightly connected with vocational and social competences of our students. Serving the apprenticeship abroad developed the spirit of enterprise, quick reaction to work market changes and strengthened self esteem through overcoming personal weaknesses. It developed also faith in individual development possibilities which will have a great impact on active and effective motion within the European work market.

Taking into consideration the growing importance of youth\u2019s mobility flow and the care of vocational education, we were undertaking actions which encouraged students to cooperate with foreign partners. The aim of the project was to support students in acquiring professional and social competences through getting familiar with new technologies related with renovation of monuments and to strengthen both multicultural bonds and to respect mutually completed work. Thanks to the participation in this project our teachers got familiar with one of the European technical languages well enough to enable basic communication. Moreover, another aim of the project was to raise the European dimension of vocational school through starting cooperation with foreign job market and the institutions of higher education. The teachers who took part in the project together with the students, gained additional experience in setting and realising practical trainings in restoration of architectural elements and properties of wood using the latest techniques, and in particular the knowledge of innovative solutions for maintenance of monuments.\nOur students, by gaining their first professional experience abroad, increased their knowledge, qualifications essential in their profession skills, which are directly related with new techniques used in the restoration, knowledge of innovative solutions applied to study properties of wood and practical skills of conservation usage.\nMethodology used for project purposes consisted of few stages which played an important part and also determined the project\u2019s success. Methodology embraced all the actions undertaken by the project partners, namely, activities that enabled the participants for mobility, attractive practical trainings, professional and cultural trips as well as monitoring evaluation and dissemination. Completing practical trainings in renovation in Italy let our students become familiar with solutions met in renovator\u2019s and wood technologist\u2019s work other than the ones in Poland. As for social competences, our students learned from each other. They practiced also the ability to cooperate and to share gained knowledge. It had and will have its impact on limiting the number of students finishing their education too early. The direct results also involved knowledge of tradition, history, culture and Italian architecture. It will later become the sense of the European togetherness. The long-term results will be tightly connected with vocational and social competences of our students. Serving the apprenticeship abroad developed the spirit of enterprise, quick reaction to work market changes and strengthened self esteem through overcoming personal weaknesses. It developed also faith in individual development possibilities which will have a great impact on active and effective motion within the European work market.

{"doc_id": "KUpWB2TnDM", "title": "APPRAIS", "description": "governAnce, quality, accountability: a Piloting Reform pRocess in kurdistAn region of Iraq Unipi Team Leader: Francesco\u00a0Marcelloni, Vice Rector for international cooperation and relations; Marco Abate, Vice Rector for Teaching\u00a0 APPRAIS addresses governance, strategic planning and management of higher education institutions, with a particular focus on enhancing the capacities of human resources and proposing a reform for the local Higher Education system through the implementation of Bologna process. APPRAIS project idea comes from the willingness of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR KRG) to improve and develop higher education system in Kurdistan region of Iraq. Within this logic, the MOHESR KRG has encouraged several Iraqi Universities to adopt the European education system thus to implement the Bologna process. Therefore, APPRAIS will contribute to allow HEIs in defining a roadmap for a better university governance and implementation of Bologna process in the HEIs of Kurdistan region of Iraq. Secondly, it will upgrade by means of training and CB action delivered by the EU universities, the skills of presidents, vice-presidents, heads of IROs and QA responsibles on strategic planning, quality assurance and credits recognition, as well as the capacities of administrative staff on university administrative management, quality assurance and internationalisation strategies. Finally, thanks to the harmonization phase, the piloting process of reform from Kurdistan region will be enlarged also to the whole country and each university will define its own institutional strategic plan. The specific objectives of APPRAIS are:-Enhancing good governance, by strengthening the definition and development of HEIs roadmap;-Improving HEIs capacities on quality assurance mechanisms, strategic planning, management and accountability practices;-Supporting the implementation of Bologna Process within HEIs in Kurdistan region of Iraq by improving knowledge on recognition of credits and learning mobility;-Adopting the university reform on good governance and Bologna process at each HEIs, through the definition and validation of institutional action plans Like any governance dimension, all the above-mentioned objectives require a strong strategic orientation and capacity to be accomplished but, at the same time, they are also preconditioning for an effective strategic planning. Consequently, the project aims at supporting each HEIs to develop their own strategies and specific action plans in order to make the governance changes possible.

{"doc_id": "ntpDW8iZpo", "title": "Pre-University schooling", "description": "Those who have intention to enroll in a three-year degree or in a single-cycle master's degree program at the University of Pisa must have completed at least 12 years of schooling in total (including primary school, eventual middle school and high school). These qualifications allow the carrying on of studies in the Italian higher education, if they have been achieved on the basis of at least the last two years of attendance with a positive outcome in the foreign educational system. Please note: those who come from the Italian academic system and have only completed one year of high school and obtained the final qualification in a foreign academic system, can submit their documents for an evaluation in order to be enrolled by sending an email to: Questo indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo. // The indication of years of schooling appears in the Declaration of Value released by the Italian diplomatic representative competent for the territory. International students who have a course of study of less than 12 years, with only 10 or 11 years of schooling and who have intention to enroll at the University of Pisa, must: -Present a certificate attesting the completion of one or two academic years or a post-secondary qualification. ATTENTION: this period of university studies cannot be evaluated for the purpose of granting an abbreviation of the Italian course of study, but it only serves to make up for the missing years to achieve the total 12 years required by the legislation. For this reason this period is accepted only for enrollment in the 1st year of the course;-Or, alternatively, obtain an Italian secondary school diploma;-Or, alternatively, if you meet the prescribed requirements, enroll in the Foundation Course Programmes. \u00a0 SPECIAL CASES: US High School Diploma Students holding a High School Diploma (HSD) who have passed at least three US \"Advanced\u00a0Placements\" (APs) with a score from 3 to 5, in three different subjects and related to the university\u00a0course selected can be enrolled in the first academic year. The holding of an \"AP\" in Italian will be a\u00a0mandatory requirement only for students with foreign citizenship. An \"AP\" in Italian will not be\u00a0acceptable in the case of students with Italian citizenship or in the case of enrolment in courses\u00a0taught entirely in English. These qualifications allow the continuation of studies in Italian higher\u00a0education institutions if they have been awarded on the basis of at least the last two years of\u00a0attendance, with a positive outcome, in the foreign education system.It will be the responsibility of the higher education institutions to perform the evaluation of\u00a0qualifications taking into account the entire education path followed, in line with the national and\u00a0international regulations in force, and on the basis of their autonomy. Students in possession of a High School Diploma which is followed and supplemented by two full\u00a0years of a further \"College\" course (Associate degree) can also be enrolled. This enrolment will be\u00a0possible even if the attendance of the course following the award of the High School Diploma\u00a0qualification takes place in university institutions of a third country. In this case, the competent\u00a0academic bodies of the Italian higher education institutions evaluate the overall adequacy of the\u00a0study path itself, which cannot in any case last less than one year. \u00a0 British qualifications The final certifications called General Certificate of Education (GCE) and International Certificate of Education (IGCE), released by official certification bodies of the United Kingdom, allow the enrolment if they certify the approval of at least three subjects at high level (A level) related to the course of study requested, with a grade at least sufficient (passing grade). An A level in italian language will be required only for students with a foreign citizenship, so it will not be counted as part of the three A levels required for students with a foreign citizenship or in case of courses delivered only in English. Furthermore, a combination of 3 different subjects from A level and Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects. The Cambridge Pre-U Diploma, composed by 3 Principal Subjects + Global Perspective and Research, can be evaluated by superior academic institutions instead of the 3 \u201cA level\u201d to access the first cycle. Remember that even with an A level or a Pre-U Principal Subject in Italian language will be required only for students with a foreign citizenship, so it will not count as part of the ones required in case of students with Italian citizenship or in case of course delivered entirely in English language. Final Diplomas obtained in British schools of which in the Allegato 2- point 3\u00a0(in English: ATTACHMENT I, point 5)\u00a0of the Nota Ministeriale, are valid to enrol to Italian Universities to the specific senses and conditions established by the agreements passed by Italy and Great Britain. Scottish titles allow enrolment if they certify the passing of at least three Advanced Highers or alternatively 2 Advanced Highers and at least 4 Highers. \u00a0 Greek academic titles \"Apolityrion\" They allow enrollment only if they are achieved with a sufficient minimum grade of 10 out of 20 points. Candidates must also have obtained the \"Veveosi Prosvasis\" academic certificate. Only students who achieved an Apolityrion certificate before 1999 and who have a document certifying they were resident in Italy during the three-year period 1999-2001, corresponding to the transitional period established by the recent Greek legislation to achieve, by amnesty, the certificate of academic suitability \"Veveosi Prosvasis\" are exempt from needing the second certificate. \u00a0 Albanian qualifications They allow access to University education courses only if the student has passed the academic suitability exam (compulsory) introduced with the reform of the Albanian school system, or has already completed a previous University enrollment. \u00a0 Qualifications issued by University Institutes of Clerical Studies, based in Italy and approved by the Holy See These educational qualifications, must be certified by the competent ecclesiastical authorities. Candidates with such authenticated and legalized qualifications only present the copy of that title to the competent University and the original is produced after the admission tests, when an eventual effective application is made.", "url": "https://www.unipi.it/index.php/enrolment/item/15690-pre-university-schooling", "lang": "en", "text": "Pre-University schooling\nContenuto principale della pagina\nMenu di navigazione\nModulo di ricerca su uniPi\nModulo di ricerca su uniPi\nwww.unipi.it\nInserisci parola da ricercare\nCerca\nCerca\nIT\nEN\nES\nPT\nHome\nUniversity\nStudy\nStudent Services\nWelcome\nResearch\nEnterprise\nInserisci parola da ricercare\nCerca\nCerca\nYou are here:\nHome\n/\nENGLISH\n/\nSTUDY\n/\nEnrolment\n/\nQualifications obtained abroad\n/\nPre-University schooling\nPre-University schooling\nPrint\nThose who have intention to enroll in a three-year degree or in a single-cycle master's degree program at the University of Pisa\nmust have completed at least 12 years of schooling\nin total (including primary school, eventual middle school and high school).

The administrative procedure for getting the research nulla osta can only be started by an Italian Research Center (e.g. a University or a similar Research Center) that has a previous agreement with the Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR). A foreign researcher or a private citizen cannot start the application by himself. At the University of Pisa, for the first step, a non-EU researcher has to apply to the Visiting Fellow Programme\u00a0and contact the International Coordinator of the Department he/she wishes to visit and carry out his/her research. Regarding the nulla osta procedure, the steps are the following: Firstly, a \"Hosting Agreement\" (Convenzione d'Accoglienza) has to be signed between the foreign researcher and the Department at the University of Pisa, which will be hosting you. Therefore the Department will forward you the \"Hosting Agreement\", which you will have to sign (two copies) and send back to your host Department in Pisa. After receiving back the Hosting Agreement signed by you, the Department at the University of Pisa will formally apply for the Italian Governmental authorization called the \"research nulla osta\", which is the official document that will allow you to apply for the research visa. In order to proceed, you will have to show that you have already booked accommodation here in Pisa (at least one month booking is necessary). If the nulla osta application is accepted, the governmental office called Prefettura (Ufficio Unico) will release the research nulla osta to your host Department staff that, on their turn, will forward the nulla osta to you as well. In the meantime, the Prefettura will inform the Italian Embassy or Consulate in the Country where you reside too, for the next issuing of your research visa. At this point, after receiving the nulla osta by your Department staff, you are allowed to apply for the research visa (our Embassy will already know your name and details of the nulla osta). After getting the research visa, upon your arrival in Italy, you must apply for the research residency permit, within the first 8 days upon your arrival. Finally, after applying for the Italian residency permit (at the post office), while waiting for its release, you are allowed to start working.

{"doc_id": "kis6gMEYf4", "title": "Newer Internet protocols but devices with higher battery drain", "description": "Is your phone draining its battery too quickly? The problem may depend on the different protocols we use to surf the web, and the latest ones are not necessarily the most energy-efficient. This is the conclusion of a study conducted by the University of Pisa and the CNR Institute for Informatics and Telematics, recently published in the journal Pervasive and Mobile Computing. Specifically, the researchers set out to evaluate the energy consumption of smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in relation to the various HTTP protocols that underpin data transmission over the Internet.\u201cIn general, when we talk about the different versions of the HTTP protocol, the focus is on \u2018performance\u2019, which is the time required to download data and resources over the network,\u201d explains Alessio Vecchio, author of the study and professor at the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Pisa. \u201cOur study, on the other hand, focused on energy consumption, which is particularly relevant in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), where many devices are battery-powered. In this context, saving energy makes it possible to significantly extend the life of the device, avoiding the need to replace or recharge batteries, with positive consequences in terms of sustainability and usability.\u201d A photo of the system \u00a0The HTTP protocol is one of the most widely used communication protocols in computer networks; suffice it to say that the web is based on it. Communication between IoT devices, such as sensors or home automation systems, is also often based on the HTTP protocol.

{"doc_id": "4t9NeSXM4u", "title": "Megalodon: study reveals the appearance of the extinct giant shark", "description": "Did the Megalodon look like the great white sharks of today\u2019s seas? For years, researchers have been wondering about the appearance of \u00a0\u00a0this huge extinct shark that lived about 15-3.6 million years ago, and finally the answer seems to have been found. A new scientific study, in which Dr Alberto Collareta, a palaeontologist at the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Pisa, took part, has shown that the giant shark known by the scientific name of Carcharocles megalodon (or Otodus megalodon) had a slimmer body than previous studies had suggested. \u201cIn science fiction novels and movies, the Megalodon is typically portrayed as a monstrous shark of titanic proportions,\" explains Dr Alberto Collareta, the only Italian member of the team of 26 international scientists, who took part in this research. \u201cThis is not surprising, since the maximum size of this shark, one of the largest marine predators that has ever existed, is now estimated at around 15-20 metres in total length, and there is little doubt about its hyper-carnivorous diet. \u201cUnderstanding the biology, evolution and extinction of the Megalodon,\" Dr. Collareta continues, \u201cis important for the significant impact this species had on the ecology and evolution of the marine ecosystems that gave rise to current oceans. However, the fossil record of Megalodon is almost essentially represented by its characteristic huge teeth, while skeletal remains are extremely rare\u201d. The lack of complete Megalodon skeletons has always led researchers to reconstruct the appearance of this ancient giant of the seas by modelling it on that of the current white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). This hypothesis has now been refuted by the study of the international research team of which Collareta is a member and which has recently published a new study in the prestigious international scientific journal Palaeontologia Electronica. This study shows that the Megalodon had a slenderer body shape than the current white shark. \u201cThis deduction,\u201d the researcher goes on to explain, \u201ccomes from the restudy of an incomplete set of fossil vertebrae belonging to a single specimen of Megalodon discovered in Belgium in the 19th century. In particular, the total body length of that specimen, if estimated on the diameter of the vertebrae of the current white shark, is much less than the length of the incomplete vertebral column alone (9.2 metres vs. 11.1 metres)\u201d \u201cThis simple observation,\u2019 Collareta concludes, \u201cstrongly suggests that Megalodon was not merely a bulkier version of the modern great white shark, but it was different from the latter in a slenderer physiognomy. Although, in the absence of complete skeletal remains, the exact shape of Megalodon\u2019s body remains uncertain, the results presented in this new research constitute the most cogent empirical evidence for such a shape and represent a significant step towards its reconstruction.

Guardia Medica Your general practicioner has work hours. This means that you cannot see him/her everytime you want to but only during their working hours. What happens when you are not feeling well and your doctor is not available? For example, when one feels sick during the night or on weekends? At this point, you should call or visit the\u00a0Guardia Medica.

Guarantees and coverage The basic guarantees are: for death: 250,000.00 Euros (two hundred and fifty thousand euros) for permanent disability: 250,000.00 Euros In the reimbursement for permanent disability, an exemption system is included, which penalizes permanent damage of a lower ranked disability, but favours the most serious cases.

{"doc_id": "SQQ9hnyXs5", "title": "Free time", "description": "Pisa is a university city full of life. Its centre boasts a wide range of meeting places: piazzas, bars, pubs, restaurants, pizzerias, clubs and live music pubs. Around Piazza Garibaldi and Piazza delle Vettovaglie you have the chance to plunge into the heart of a youthful lifestyle and enjoy the classic \"happy hour\" in one of the many bars of this area. The cultural life in Pisa revolves around museums, cultural associations, cinemas and theatres where programmes of events include theatre, concerts, opera, dance and other events. The most important theatre is the Teatro Verdi located in the city centre, built between 1865 and 1867 which was officially opened with the opera \"Guglielmo Tell\" by Rossini. This theatre has one of\u00a0 the biggest stages in Italy. Besides the Teatro Verdi there is Sant'Andrea Theatre located inside the Romanesque Sant'Andrea Church (12th Century). There is also CinemaTeatroLux located in Santa Caterina Square in the ancient chapel of SS. Salvatore (14th Century). The two latter theatres often host shows of local companies at very cheap prices. If you like going to the cinema, there are many in the city centre as well as outside the medieval walls. At the Arsenale Cine Club you can find movies in various European languages. Wednesdays is Spectator's Day at the cinemas, so tickets cost only 4,50\u20ac instead of 7,00\u20ac. Many young people take advantage of this discount to go to the cinema. If you like exhibitions many of them are hosted at the Palazzo Blu and at the Expo Center SMS San Michele degli Scalzi. Events During the year you can participate in several events. Don't forget to mark the following dates on your calendar: May The feast of Saint Ubaldo, flower market along the river Arno at Le Piagge. June In this month many events are organized, which is why residents call it \"giugno pisano\". 16th June: the Luminara, on the eve of the feast of the Patron Saint, all the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings on the Arno embankmentsare illuminated by candles and nightlights (also called lampadini). The feast, also called \"the Lights of San Ranieri\" reaches its climax with a beautiful firework show. 17th June: Palio of San Ranieri, feast of Pisa's Patron Saint. In the afternoon four boats representing the colours of the most ancient districts of the city take part in a regatta on the river Arno. This is a vestige of the prestigious tradition of Pisa as oneof the ancient Maritime Republics. Last Sunday of June: the Battle of the Bridge (Gioco del Ponte).

{"doc_id": "VPUxyhHArV", "title": "Neural Networks for Archaeologists, with Python", "description": "Archaeology deals with the study of the human past, conducted through\u00a0material remains, i.e. artefacts that were manufactured, used, and\u00a0discarded in ancient times. One of the most important tasks is to classify\u00a0the artefacts, determining chronology, cultural attribution, form, function\u00a0and other features. Neural networks and deep learning are powerful tools\u00a0for supporting and facilitating such tasks, often time-consuming and\u00a0heavily depending on prior knowledge and expertise. The \u201cNeural Networks for Archaeologists, with Python\u201d Winter School\u00a0illustrates the use of neural networks for analysing and classifying\u00a0multimodal data, such as images, tables, and texts. It is conducted, with a\u00a0hands-on approach, through Python, one of the main programming\u00a0languages of AI and Data Science, including a wide variety of deep learning\u00a0tools and network architectures. In order to effectively conduct and\u00a0support the analysis and classification of data coming from tables, images\u00a0and texts, modern archaeologists should be able to deal with concepts and\u00a0tools related to these technologies. Such skills are not present in a standard\u00a0archaeology background, though they are fundamental to effectively\u00a0nteracting with ICT experts. Bibliography: Stevens E., Antoga L., Viehmann T., Deep Learning with Pytorch, Manning (2020). The Winter School will last 60 hours, from February 3rd\u00a0to 14th, 2025, and it will take place on campus in Pisa, at the Department of Civilisations and Forms of Knowledge, in Via Trieste, 40. The program will be activated also in distance learning mode (TEAMS platform).

{"doc_id": "2N2XacThPM", "title": "Vada Volaterrana Archaeological Field School", "description": "\u00a0 \u00a0 The Vada Volaterrana harbour project stems from the long lasting researches conducted by the staff of the Laboratory of Ancient Topography of the University of Pisa in San Gaetano di Vada (Rosignano Marittimo, Livorno), and all along the coast of Northern Tuscany, in order to reconstruct the townscapes and landscapes of Northern Etruria in a diacronic perspective. Our project focuses on Vada Volaterrana, the core of the harbour system of Volterra, one of the most famous Etruscan and Roman cities in Italy. Here, a settlement of considerable interest has been identified in San Gaetano di Vada: it is a port area which has been excavated by the members of the staff and students of the Vada Volaterrana Archaeological Field School. The excavations are part of an interdisciplinary project aimed at defining the paleogeography of the Vada Volaterrana area during Etruscan and Roman times. The project includes paleoenvironmental researches and Ground Penetrating Radar prospections to identify the full extent of the Vada Volaterrana settlement. Moreover, systematic underwater surveys are being conducted in the Vada Volaterrana seabed, in order to identify ancient harbour facilities and enhance our understanding of shipwrecks and underwater findings in the area. Since 2018 the Vada Volaterrana Harbour Project started a partnership with professor Stephen Carmody of Troy University (Alabama) aimed in deepening paleobotanical and environmental features of the area. Flotation of Vada excavated layers provided unexpected and interesting results about landscapes in a diachronical perspective, tree essences and food supply in ancient coastal Etruria. The Summer School will be held on campus in\u00a0Rosignano M.mo (LIvorno), Frazione Vada,\u00a0Localit\u00e0 San Gaetano, via del Porto. Aim The Summer school aims at providing participants with the understanding of the different activities inherent to the job of archaeologist, both in the field and the lab. The Summer School at Vada Volaterrana is an excellent opportunity for students to gain practical experience in archaeological investigation, working side-by-side with skilfull and experienced researchers in the field. The members of the staff will explain how archaeologists work, from the identification of ancient sites through surveys and GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) investigations to the stratigraphic excavation.

Here, a settlement of considerable interest has been identified in San Gaetano di Vada: it is a port area which has been excavated by the members of the staff and students of the Vada Volaterrana Archaeological Field School.\nThe excavations are part of an interdisciplinary project aimed at defining the paleogeography of the Vada Volaterrana area during Etruscan and Roman times. The project includes paleoenvironmental researches and Ground Penetrating Radar prospections to identify the full extent of the Vada Volaterrana settlement. Moreover, systematic underwater surveys are being conducted in the Vada Volaterrana seabed, in order to identify ancient harbour facilities and enhance our understanding of shipwrecks and underwater findings in the area.\nSince 2018 the Vada Volaterrana Harbour Project started a partnership with professor Stephen Carmody of Troy University (Alabama) aimed in deepening paleobotanical and environmental features of the area. Flotation of Vada excavated layers provided unexpected and interesting results about landscapes in a diachronical perspective, tree essences and food supply in ancient coastal Etruria.\nThe Summer School will be held on campus in\u00a0Rosignano M.mo (LIvorno), Frazione Vada,\u00a0Localit\u00e0 San Gaetano, via del Porto.\nAim\nThe Summer school aims at providing participants with the understanding of the different activities inherent to the job of archaeologist, both in the field and the lab. The Summer School at Vada Volaterrana is an excellent opportunity for students to gain practical experience in archaeological investigation, working side-by-side with skilfull and experienced researchers in the field. The members of the staff will explain how archaeologists work, from the identification of ancient sites through surveys and GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) investigations to the stratigraphic excavation.\nWho can apply\nOur Summer school welcomes University students in Archaeology, Classics, History, and Arts at the undergraduate and graduate levels who wish to have an hands-on experience of archaeological excavation in Italy.\nLanguage\nEnglish\nProgram Intensity\nFull time\nApplication\nAdmission Requirements\nBeing\u00a0University students in Archaeology, Classics, History, and Arts at the undergraduate and graduate levels.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:\nThe Summer School will be activated with at least 4 students\nThe maximum number of participants is set to 12 students\nRequired documents\nIdentity Document (*PASSPORT in case you are a foreign student*)\nEnrolment Form\nCurriculum Vitae\nProof of tetanus vaccination\nA specialist\u2019s note is required only for students with specifical medical needs\nAll the documents must be in pdf format, in order to upload them on the portal when required.\nApplication has to be submitted via\nAlice portal\nfollowing the instructions of the\n\"How to apply\" page\n.\nECTS\n6\nFees\n1000 euro\n(+ 1180 to cover transports from and to the site, housing, meals, excavation, laboratory equipment and staff costs)\nPay fees and accomodation costs by Debit/Credit Card or PayPal online using the following form filling it with all the required data:\nPayment Form\nNOTICE:\nInternational students without Italian Tax Code: please tick the box 'Anonymous' in order to disable the field 'Italian personal ID/VAT number'.\nPlease type your NAME and SURNAME next to the pre-filled text of the field 'Reason'\nPlease pay only after receiving the admission letter\nNOTICE: Both tuition fees (1.000,00 euro) and accomodation costs (1.180,00 euro) are included in the total amount\nREFUND POLICY:\nA refund of 1000 euro is provided for documented cases of student illness/accident and family bereavement, reported within 15 days of the start of the Summer School.\nFundings\nPlease contact the coordinator to get information.\nPeriod\n6 - 25 July 2025\nApplication Deadline\n3 June 2025\nContacts\nCoordinator\nProf. Simonetta Menchelli\nQuesto indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo.\nWebsite\nhttps://vadavolaterrana.cfs.unipi.it/\nSummer/Winter School Office\nQuesto indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo.\nUltima modifica:\nVen 25 Ott 2024 - 08:34\nQuesto sito utilizza solo cookie tecnici, propri e di terze parti, per il corretto funzionamento delle pagine web e per il miglioramento dei servizi.

{"doc_id": "GBsnxcRRiQ", "title": "Consciousness and Cognition", "description": "The enigma of consciousness is perhaps the most fascinating and enduring mystery in the universe. There are many hypotheses on the basis of which we try give an answer to the most difficult problems but, wanting to schematize,\u00a0all can be traced back to two broad categories: those who consider\u00a0Consciousness entirely reducible to the electro-chemical-physical\u00a0processes that take place in the brain, and those who don\u2019t grant for such a\u00a0solution.Sharing the first hypothesis means leaning towards the so-called Scientific\u00a0Materialism, a monist and reductionist approach to the reality, whereas\u00a0being sceptical towards this possibility and embracing a non-reductionist\u00a0perspective can decline in very different options, ranging from dualist\u00a0approaches, postulating the existence of a proto-psychic substance\u00a0independent from a physical substratum, to non-substantialist views,\u00a0suggesting an overall reconsideration of the subject-object relation in order to face the problem of consciousness. This latter hypothesis will be\u00a0investigated from different perspectives, such as quantum physics,\u00a0biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, but also and especially from\u00a0the perspective of contemplative practices. The insights drawn from these fields of enquiry will be thread together within a philosophical framework\u00a0strongly inspired by phenomenology. In fact two domains that are apparently very different, such as the one of\u00a0Quantum Physics and the one of meditation and yoga, on the contrary\u00a0show, through a phenomenological key of understanding, some surprising\u00a0convergences. The first constitutes the most advanced approach to the\u00a0study of the physical world, which also extends to phenomena that take\u00a0place at the nanoscopic level in biological tissues, while the latter allow for\u00a0a millenarian profound and accurate exploration of issues that are not\u00a0accessible with objective methods and that concern the first-person\u00a0experience. Nonetheless when it comes to consciousness they both seem\u00a0to point towards a similar direction. Moreover, answering the question if Scientific Materialism is capable of\u00a0embracing the totality of Reality, included consciousness, has a lot to do\u00a0with what is meant by consciousness and what is meant by cognition. Within ongoing cognitive debate the exploration of consciousness is\u00a0usually merged and sometimes reduced to the study of the processes\u00a0through which cognition takes place. But is the mere study of the cognitive\u00a0faculties sufficient to shed light on the mystery of Consciousness which,\u00a0itself, is a pre-condition for every single cognition to take place? In order to start tackling these questions, the summer-school is born with a\u00a0multidisciplinary vocation that brings neurosciences, but also biology,\u00a0artificial intelligence, and physics in dialogue with epistemological issue at\u00a0stake in phenomenology and Eastern philosophies and contemplative\u00a0practice. For this reason the contribution of highly qualified teachers\u00a0coming from very different backgrounds is required. A specific space will be reserved for the experiential aspect in order to\u00a0integrate the lessons with familiarization sessions with contemplative\u00a0practices (Yoga and Meditation). The sessions will be conducted by highly\u00a0qualified teachers with specific experience and will also be usable by the\u00a0students who will attend the school online. The 2025 edition of the Summer School Consciousness and Cognition is organized by the University of Pisa in collaboration with the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, with the patronage of the Italian Buddhist Union. The School will take place in a residential form at Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, 35 Km from Pisa, thanks to a convention\u00a0between the University of Pisa and the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, renowned for the excellent quality of its study programs of\u00a0Buddhist philosophy and psychology. The program will be activated also in distance learning mode (TEAMS platform).\u00a0 Aim Philosophy: To acquire sensitivity to the existence of a dimension of consciousness that overcomes the distinction between subject and object and to understand its role in the current quest to explain consciousness, through a progression into insights drawn from Western philosophical approaches (especially phenomenology) and Eastern traditions and practices. Quantum mechanics: To understand the basic principles of quantum mechanics and comprehend the subtler issues connected with the interpretation of the theory and their possible relevance for a discussion of consciousness, of the mind-body problem, and the nature of reality itself. Artificial intelligence and Consciousness: To learn the basic concepts and models of nature-inspired computational techniques and to know how to apply them to a wide range of applications. Students will be exposed to the advantages and challenges of using computationally intelligent systems with human-like capabilities in terms of reasoning, learning, and adaptation.\u00a0The ethical and social issues arising from the use of robots that\u00a0mimic the behavior of conscious and aware entities will also be addressed. Biosemiotics: To learn the basics of biosemiotics and become acquainted with the semiotic nature of sign relationships in both biological and human-made systems, understand how cells act as semiotic units capable of interpreting their own environment through sign exchange, and eventually comprehend how sign perception and epigenetic regulation are causally linked through differential gene expression. Contemplative practices: To comprehend the vision of Eastern traditions (Hinduism and Buddhism) concerning consciousness and its different levels and manifestations and to learn the foundations, characteristics, and aspects of the different types of meditation. Neurosciences and non-ordinary states of consciousness:\u00a0After a description of the neural networks acting in the brain and a survey on the main techniques for investigating brain activity (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), to understand how self induced not ordinary\u00a0states of consciousness by natural drugs, hypnosis, dream, deep\u00a0meditation, affect this activity. Practice:\u00a0To become familiar with the experiential aspects of contemplative practices through meditation and yoga sessions led by highly qualified teachers. Like the rest of the program, these sessions will also be available to online students. Who can apply The program is aimed at all those who are interested in the phenomenon of\u00a0Consciousness with particular attention, mainly, but not exclusively, to\u00a0university students of Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience,\u00a0Bioengineering, Biology, Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Physics as well as\u00a0Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists etc. Language English Program Intensity Full-time Application Admission Requirements Students enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's Degree course, or people already\u00a0in possession of the aforementioned qualifications or equivalent qualifications.

This latter hypothesis will be\u00a0investigated from different perspectives, such as quantum physics,\u00a0biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, but also and especially from\u00a0the perspective of contemplative practices.

The first constitutes the most advanced approach to the\u00a0study of the physical world, which also extends to phenomena that take\u00a0place at the nanoscopic level in biological tissues, while the latter allow for\u00a0a millenarian profound and accurate exploration of issues that are not\u00a0accessible with objective methods and that concern the first-person\u00a0experience. Nonetheless when it comes to consciousness they both seem\u00a0to point towards a similar direction.\nMoreover, answering the question if Scientific Materialism is capable of\u00a0embracing the totality of Reality, included consciousness, has a lot to do\u00a0with what is meant by consciousness and what is meant by cognition. Within ongoing cognitive debate the exploration of consciousness is\u00a0usually merged and sometimes reduced to the study of the processes\u00a0through which cognition takes place. But is the mere study of the cognitive\u00a0faculties sufficient to shed light on the mystery of Consciousness which,\u00a0itself, is a pre-condition for every single cognition to take place?\nIn order to start tackling these questions, the summer-school is born with a\u00a0multidisciplinary vocation that brings neurosciences, but also biology,\u00a0artificial intelligence, and physics in dialogue with epistemological issue at\u00a0stake in phenomenology and Eastern philosophies and contemplative\u00a0practice.

Students will be exposed to the advantages and challenges of using computationally intelligent systems with human-like capabilities in terms of reasoning, learning, and adaptation.\u00a0The ethical and social issues arising from the use of robots that\u00a0mimic the behavior of conscious and aware entities will also be addressed.\nBiosemiotics\n: To learn the basics of biosemiotics and become acquainted with the semiotic nature of sign relationships in both biological and human-made systems, understand how cells act as semiotic units capable of interpreting their own environment through sign exchange, and eventually comprehend how sign perception and epigenetic regulation are causally linked through differential gene expression.\nContemplative practices\n: To comprehend the vision of Eastern traditions (Hinduism and Buddhism) concerning consciousness and its different levels and manifestations and to learn the foundations, characteristics, and aspects of the different types of meditation.\nNeurosciences and non-ordinary states of consciousness:\nAfter a description of the neural networks acting in the brain and a survey on the main techniques for investigating brain activity (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), to understand how self induced not ordinary\u00a0states of consciousness by natural drugs, hypnosis, dream, deep\u00a0meditation, affect this activity.\nPractice:\nTo become familiar with the experiential aspects of contemplative practices through meditation and yoga sessions led by highly qualified teachers. Like the rest of the program, these sessions will also be available to online students.\nWho can apply\nThe program is aimed at all those who are interested in the phenomenon of\u00a0Consciousness with particular attention, mainly, but not exclusively, to\u00a0university students of Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience,\u00a0Bioengineering, Biology, Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Physics as well as\u00a0Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists etc.\nLanguage\nEnglish\nProgram Intensity\nFull-time\nApplication\nAdmission Requirements\nStudents enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's Degree course, or people already\u00a0in possession of the aforementioned qualifications or equivalent qualifications.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:\nThe Summer School will be activated with at least 25 students\nThe maximum number of participants is set to 80 students\nRequired Documents\nIdentity Document (*PASSPORT in case you are a foreign student*)\nEnrolment Form\nCurriculum Vitae\nAll the documents must be in pdf format, in order to upload them on the portal when required.\nApplication has to be submitted via\nAlice portal\nfollowing the instructions of the\n\"How to apply\" page\n.\nECTS\n6\nFees\nOn campus attendance:\nFull fee\n500 euro\nReduced fee for students*\n350 euro\nReduced fee for students* coming from low GDP\u00a0countries**\n250 euro\nReduced fee for UNIPI students* and employees\n250 euro\nOnline attendance:\nFull fee\n250 euro\nReduced fee for students* coming from low GDP countries**\n150 euro\n* Students are those who are enrolled in a Bachelor or in a Master Degree course\n**\u00a0Low GDP Countries are those countries with less than 6000 $ of GDP per capita.\u00a0For their list please refer to the\nTuition Fees Regulation\navailable for download at the bottom of the webpage.\nInfomation about the payment method will be published in the coming weeks.\nREFUND POLICY: In the event of justified inability to participate in the Summer School\u00a0communicated before the start date, the entire fee paid will be refunded.\nFundings\nThe students interested to apply for a scholarship are kindly requested to send an email directly to the Director of the Summer School, Prof. Bruno Neri\nQuesto indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo.\n, following the instructions of the\nScholarship Regulation\nwhich is available for download at the bottom of this webpage.\nAccomodation\nThe School will take place in a residential form at Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, 35 Km from Pisa.\nInfo about\u00a0available accommodations and their costs can be found at the following webpage:\nILTK - Accomodation and costs\n.\nThe Lama Tzong Khapa Institute will reserve a number of places appropriate to the number of students enrolled.\nTo book accommodation please go to:\nILTK - Book accomodation for Consciousness and Cognition\nTo get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe type of accommodation and places, check the following webpage:\nILTK - Accomodation and costs\n.

{"doc_id": "v6gG9drp4V", "title": "Leveraging Ecological Economics to advance the Sustainability Transition", "description": "The twentieth century saw enormous leaps and bounds in addressing various challenges pertaining to human development - e.g. rapid economic growth, the recognition of climate risks, poverty alleviation, better healthcare for many, addressing racial, gender, and religious inequities, etc. Such trends call for a deep understanding of the interlinkages among social, economic, and environmental challenges to provide policy advice for a legitimate, fair, and evidence-informed transition towards sustainability. Ecological Economics, with its core emphasis on interdisciplinarity and incommensurability, provides a valuable conceptual framework for exploring the needed transitions towards sustainability. Please visit the dedicated website for the full description of the contents and the organizational details. The Summer School will be held on campus, in Pisa, at Centro Congressi Le Benedettine, Piazza San Paolo a Ripa D'Arno, 16. Aim Upon completion of the summer school, students will understand the founding epistemological and analytical tools of ecological economics, which will be used to explore current sustainability challenges and the recent concepts of post growth/degrowth. Students will be able to formulate their own informed perspective on sustainable development, and develop realistic policies/strategies for the transition towards sustainable development.

The Summer School is structured in a 5-day course characterized by lectures and hands on training covering all the most useful techniques involved in facial reconstruction after skin cancer excision. Each day a different anatomical unit of the face will be covered and the daily schedule will be divided into two sessions: Morning: frontal lecture regarding the clinical anatomy of the district and description of the different reconstructive options. Afternoon: practical training in the OR during which the participants will be involved in the patient evaluation, the design and planning of the different reconstructive options and assist during surgeries. The Summer School will be held on campus in Pisa, at Ospedale Santa Chiara Ed. 15 Chirurgia Plastica, Via Bonanno Pisano, 10. Aim The aim of the Summer School is to give participants the detailed knowledge and expertise needed to achieve the best results in the full range of reconstructive procedures involving local flaps of the face. The anatomy, physiology and biomechanics of the facial skin and muscles will be addressed and followed by OR experience to evaluate and understand patients\u2019 variability. Focus on proper skin cancer resection with adequate margins will be followed by the evaluation of multiple reconstructive options.The decision-making process will be critically explained to the student and the techniques of flap planning, flap harvesting and donor site morbidity will be discussed.Reconstructive surgery of the nose, lip, eyelid, forehead and ear will be specifically reviewed to give the student a wide spectrum of possible reconstructive options, with a step-by-step approach to each procedure, completed by tips and tricks from leading experts.Moreover, skin closure options will be reviewed including updates on the latest materials used and the new technologies involved in wound closure.

{"doc_id": "oavszgspKF", "title": "Microwaves and mm-waves for the Design of Advanced Wireless Links: Communication, Sensing and Power Transfer", "description": "This Summer School offers 6 ECTS credits through the delivering of 52-hour lectures. Attendees will get an introduction to EM fundamentals and then they will learn how to apply those to the design and implementation of future communication systems, radars, wireless sensing systems, wireless networks and high-frequency circuits. The Summer School lectures are subdivided into two parts. The first part is devoted to a concise and basic description of the most important EM phenomena: wave propagation in free space, inhomogeneous media and guiding structures; properties and characteristic parameters of passive devices, transceivers and antennas. Experimental measurements and introduction to commercial EM solvers are also planned. The second part of the lecturers is devoted to highlight how the EM phenomena and devices previously reviewed are applied in some of the most advanced wireless systems. Lecturers, from both academia and ICT industry, will focus on the design criteria, technical features, architectures and innovative aspects directly induced by EM concepts in non-terrestrial networks, 5G mobile communications, wireless power transfer systems, V2X communications, global LEO constellation networks, microwave systems for aerospace and defense. To fully pursue the Summer School goals and provide the most effective outcome, lecturers are selected among academia (University of Pisa and University of Bologna), ICT industry and international research centers. On one day of the Summer School week, the lectures will be given at the Marconi\u2019s Museum in Villa Griffone, Pontecchio Marconi (close to Bologna). In the morning, the attendees will have a guided tour of the museum and see some experiments emulating those made by the pioneer of the radio communications (Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1909) in his family country estate in the late XIX century. In the afternoon, two lecturers on WPT (wireless power transfer) systems and RIS (Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces) for 6G mobile communications will be given by recognized experts from the University of Bologna. The bus transfer for the round trip to Pontecchio Marconi will be provided by the Summer School organizers.\u00a0 Students interested to earn the 6 ECTS credits are required to agree with the Summer School coordinators on a Project Work topic, and then submit their written report no later than 30 August 2025 (pdf submission by email to Questo indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo. // and Questo indirizzo email \u00e8 protetto dagli spambots. \u00c8 necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo. // ).

Aim The second edition of the Summer School \u201dMicrowaves and mm-waves for\u00a0the design of advanced wireless links: communication, sensing and power\u00a0transfer\u201daims to introduce the attendees to the building blocks required to understand the basic principles, the implementation strategies and the design criteria of the most common wireless systems operating in the microwaves and mm-waves frequency bands. An overview of the fundamental electromagnetic (EM) phenomena will be provided and exploited, to describe the most important high-frequency devices of the wireless system physical layer.The Summer School will support the gain of skills useful to control the EM propagation, thus helping the attendees to face the challenging and ever-evolving specifications of advanced wireless systems. The Summer School can be of interest for students (PhD students, postgraduate students, and undergraduate students who are close to getting their degree), practitioners and industry employees, who are involved in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) fields and aim to exploit the EM phenomena to shape future communication systems, radars, wireless sensing systems, wireless networks and high-frequency circuits. Lecture contents do not require a background in electromagnetics, yet experimental measurements and commercial simulation tools will be used to validate EM basic concepts, as an effective alternative to conventional approaches based only on analytical derivations. Who can apply PhD students, postgraduate students, undergraduate students who are close to getting their degree, practitioners and industry employees, who are involved in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) fields and, more generally, in STEM disciplines.

{"doc_id": "s59XppdXez", "title": "Consciousness and Cognition", "description": "The enigma of consciousness is perhaps the most fascinating and enduring mystery in the universe. There are many hypotheses on the basis of which we try give an answer to the most difficult problems but, wanting to schematize,\u00a0all can be traced back to two broad categories: those who consider\u00a0Consciousness entirely reducible to the electro-chemical-physical\u00a0processes that take place in the brain, and those who don\u2019t grant for such a\u00a0solution.Sharing the first hypothesis means leaning towards the so-called Scientific\u00a0Materialism, a monist and reductionist approach to the reality, whereas\u00a0being sceptical towards this possibility and embracing a non-reductionist\u00a0perspective can decline in very different options, ranging from dualist\u00a0approaches, postulating the existence of a proto-psychic substance\u00a0independent from a physical substratum, to non-substantialist views,\u00a0suggesting an overall reconsideration of the subject-object relation in order to face the problem of consciousness. This latter hypothesis will be\u00a0investigated from different perspectives, such as quantum physics,\u00a0biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, but also and especially from\u00a0the perspective of contemplative practices. The insights drawn from these fields of enquiry will be thread together within a philosophical framework\u00a0strongly inspired by phenomenology. In fact two domains that are apparently very different, such as the one of\u00a0Quantum Physics and the one of meditation and yoga, on the contrary\u00a0show, through a phenomenological key of understanding, some surprising\u00a0convergences. The first constitutes the most advanced approach to the\u00a0study of the physical world, which also extends to phenomena that take\u00a0place at the nanoscopic level in biological tissues, while the latter allow for\u00a0a millenarian profound and accurate exploration of issues that are not\u00a0accessible with objective methods and that concern the first-person\u00a0experience. Nonetheless when it comes to consciousness they both seem\u00a0to point towards a similar direction. Moreover, answering the question if Scientific Materialism is capable of\u00a0embracing the totality of Reality, included consciousness, has a lot to do\u00a0with what is meant by consciousness and what is meant by cognition. Within ongoing cognitive debate the exploration of consciousness is\u00a0usually merged and sometimes reduced to the study of the processes\u00a0through which cognition takes place. But is the mere study of the cognitive\u00a0faculties sufficient to shed light on the mystery of Consciousness which,\u00a0itself, is a pre-condition for every single cognition to take place? In order to start tackling these questions, the summer-school is born with a\u00a0multidisciplinary vocation that brings neurosciences, but also biology,\u00a0artificial intelligence, and physics in dialogue with epistemological issue at\u00a0stake in phenomenology and Eastern philosophies and contemplative\u00a0practice. For this reason the contribution of highly qualified teachers\u00a0coming from very different backgrounds is required. A specific space will be reserved for the experiential aspect in order to\u00a0integrate the lessons with familiarization sessions with contemplative\u00a0practices (Yoga and Meditation). The sessions will be conducted by highly\u00a0qualified teachers with specific experience and will also be usable by the\u00a0students who will attend the school online. The 2025 edition of the Summer School Consciousness and Cognition is organized by the University of Pisa in collaboration with the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, with the patronage of the Italian Buddhist Union. The School will take place in a residential form at Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, 35 Km from Pisa, thanks to a convention\u00a0between the University of Pisa and the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, renowned for the excellent quality of its study programs of\u00a0Buddhist philosophy and psychology. The program will be activated also in distance learning mode (TEAMS platform).\u00a0 Aim Philosophy: To acquire sensitivity to the existence of a dimension of consciousness that overcomes the distinction between subject and object and to understand its role in the current quest to explain consciousness, through a progression into insights drawn from Western philosophical approaches (especially phenomenology) and Eastern traditions and practices. Quantum mechanics: To understand the basic principles of quantum mechanics and comprehend the subtler issues connected with the interpretation of the theory and their possible relevance for a discussion of consciousness, of the mind-body problem, and the nature of reality itself. Artificial intelligence and Consciousness: To learn the basic concepts and models of nature-inspired computational techniques and to know how to apply them to a wide range of applications. Students will be exposed to the advantages and challenges of using computationally intelligent systems with human-like capabilities in terms of reasoning, learning, and adaptation.\u00a0The ethical and social issues arising from the use of robots that\u00a0mimic the behavior of conscious and aware entities will also be addressed. Biosemiotics: To learn the basics of biosemiotics and become acquainted with the semiotic nature of sign relationships in both biological and human-made systems, understand how cells act as semiotic units capable of interpreting their own environment through sign exchange, and eventually comprehend how sign perception and epigenetic regulation are causally linked through differential gene expression. Contemplative practices: To comprehend the vision of Eastern traditions (Hinduism and Buddhism) concerning consciousness and its different levels and manifestations and to learn the foundations, characteristics, and aspects of the different types of meditation. Neurosciences and non-ordinary states of consciousness:\u00a0After a description of the neural networks acting in the brain and a survey on the main techniques for investigating brain activity (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), to understand how self induced not ordinary\u00a0states of consciousness by natural drugs, hypnosis, dream, deep\u00a0meditation, affect this activity. Practice:\u00a0To become familiar with the experiential aspects of contemplative practices through meditation and yoga sessions led by highly qualified teachers. Like the rest of the program, these sessions will also be available to online students. Who can apply The program is aimed at all those who are interested in the phenomenon of\u00a0Consciousness with particular attention, mainly, but not exclusively, to\u00a0university students of Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience,\u00a0Bioengineering, Biology, Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Physics as well as\u00a0Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists etc. Language English Program Intensity Full-time Application Admission Requirements Students enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's Degree course, or people already\u00a0in possession of the aforementioned qualifications or equivalent qualifications.

There are many hypotheses on the basis of which we try give an answer to the most difficult problems but, wanting to schematize,\u00a0all can be traced back to two broad categories: those who consider\u00a0Consciousness entirely reducible to the electro-chemical-physical\u00a0processes that take place in the brain, and those who don\u2019t grant for such a\u00a0solution.Sharing the first hypothesis means leaning towards the so-called Scientific\u00a0Materialism, a monist and reductionist approach to the reality, whereas\u00a0being sceptical towards this possibility and embracing a non-reductionist\u00a0perspective can decline in very different options, ranging from dualist\u00a0approaches, postulating the existence of a proto-psychic substance\u00a0independent from a physical substratum, to non-substantialist views,\u00a0suggesting an overall reconsideration of the subject-object relation in\norder to face the problem of consciousness. This latter hypothesis will be\u00a0investigated from different perspectives, such as quantum physics,\u00a0biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, but also and especially from\u00a0the perspective of contemplative practices. The insights drawn from these fields of enquiry will be thread together within a philosophical framework\u00a0strongly inspired by phenomenology.\nIn fact two domains that are apparently very different, such as the one of\u00a0Quantum Physics and the one of meditation and yoga, on the contrary\u00a0show, through a phenomenological key of understanding, some surprising\u00a0convergences. The first constitutes the most advanced approach to the\u00a0study of the physical world, which also extends to phenomena that take\u00a0place at the nanoscopic level in biological tissues, while the latter allow for\u00a0a millenarian profound and accurate exploration of issues that are not\u00a0accessible with objective methods and that concern the first-person\u00a0experience. Nonetheless when it comes to consciousness they both seem\u00a0to point towards a similar direction.\nMoreover, answering the question if Scientific Materialism is capable of\u00a0embracing the totality of Reality, included consciousness, has a lot to do\u00a0with what is meant by consciousness and what is meant by cognition. Within ongoing cognitive debate the exploration of consciousness is\u00a0usually merged and sometimes reduced to the study of the processes\u00a0through which cognition takes place. But is the mere study of the cognitive\u00a0faculties sufficient to shed light on the mystery of Consciousness which,\u00a0itself, is a pre-condition for every single cognition to take place?\nIn order to start tackling these questions, the summer-school is born with a\u00a0multidisciplinary vocation that brings neurosciences, but also biology,\u00a0artificial intelligence, and physics in dialogue with epistemological issue at\u00a0stake in phenomenology and Eastern philosophies and contemplative\u00a0practice. For this reason the contribution of highly qualified teachers\u00a0coming from very different backgrounds is required.\nA specific space will be reserved for the experiential aspect in order to\u00a0integrate the lessons with familiarization sessions with contemplative\u00a0practices (Yoga and Meditation).

{"doc_id": "cgW9WQMtEf", "title": "Integrated Water Monitoring Assessment Across Time and Scale: Groundwater-Wetland Ecosystem Interactions", "description": "Wetlands and Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are important\u00a0natural systems that contribute to ecological and human well-being\u00a0through the provisioning of ecosystem services such as supporting\u00a0biodiversity, providing base flows to rivers, water purification, water\u00a0supply and recreational opportunities. The Mediterranean basin hosts\u00a0numerous inland and coastal GDE. However \u2013 despite their uniqueness \u2013\u00a0they are increasingly subject to anthropogenic pressures, resulting in\u00a0degradation of their natural properties. These threats include both shortlived\u00a0processes (e.g. over pumping and contamination) and long-term ones\u00a0(e.g. climate change) and require sound scientific knowledge to implement\u00a0sustainable protection measures.For this reason, the Summer School will cover different topics necessary to\u00a0better asses the intricate relationships between the geosphere,\u00a0hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere, for a comprehensive\u00a0characterization of GDEs, including: Hydrogeochemistry (gas and physicochemical parameters): to evaluate groundwater natural composition and assess deviations from natural baseline values; Structural geology: to better assess the geometry of groundwater flow path; Isotope hydrology:\u00a0to trace groundwater recharge processes and age; Hydrogeology: to identify groundwater flow paths and support geochemical pieces of evidence on water-rock interaction and mixing processes with surface water to complement vulnerability assessments; Socio-hydrogeology: to assess the socio-economic impact of mineral and thermal waters, and to understand how to effectively translate scientific outcomes to the water users; Ecology:\u00a0to analyse biodiversity and ecological processes towards\u00a0innovative solutions for GDEs restoration, combining both natural and\u00a0social sciences. The school will take place in Corsica, a unique place for testing integrated\u00a0approaches, characterized by the presence of a multi-composite\u00a0geological and hydroclimatic context, giving origin to various GDEs.Indeed, as a Mediterranean mountainous Island, the Corsica is well known\u00a0as a biodiversity and geo-diversity hotspot, hosting 220 Km\u00b2 of wetlands\u00a0and GDEs: coastal lagoons, alluvial wetlands, river banks and mouths,\u00a0temporary ponds, low and high-altitude peatlands. Most of them are of\u00a0high heritage value, and 5 of them are listed as RAMSAR sites: Biguglia,\u00a0Urbino, the Palo coastal lagoons, the Tre Padule de Suartone temporary\u00a0pond, and the Moltifao peatland. Even if Corsica\u2019s wetlands appear\u00a0obviously groundwater-dependent considering the Mediterranean\u00a0hydroclimate context, recent scientific publications allowed a better\u00a0characterization and quantification of catchment water balance\u00a0components supplying Corsican GDEs over time and space. Integrated geological and environmental tools are very interesting when\u00a0used together because they can provide information on water origins and\u00a0chemical properties, as well as an estimation of the timing of the hydroecological\u00a0processes. Especially, considering the steep relief and geology\u00a0diversity of the Corsica Island, environmental stable and radioactive\u00a0natural tracers seem well adapted for functional and qualitative\u00a0assessment of hydrological fluxes supplying GDEs. Like many coastal areas in the Mediterranean, the Corsica Island is under an\u00a0increasing pressure from the combined effects of climate change,\u00a0population growth, agriculture, and tourism. Then, surface and\u00a0groundwater flows can also become sources of pollutants and\u00a0contaminants, linking GDEs to all human activities in the catchment area,\u00a0and increasing GDEs qualitative vulnerability. In this context, the Summer School aims at giving key scientific concepts and practical tools to increase\u00a0and disseminate knowledge on GDEs functioning, and rise innovative ideas\u00a0for a sustainable use and management combining both natural and social\u00a0sciences.More broadly, the Summer School will offer a unique opportunity tovcombine foundational and applied geological knowledge with\u00a0interdisciplinary learning, enhance field and lab skills, explore academic\u00a0pathways at UCPP and UNIPI, connect research with professional\u00a0opportunities, engage in language practice and cultural exchange, expand\u00a0international networks, and promote lifelong learning. The Summer School is jointly organised by the University of Pisa (UNIPI,\u00a0Italy) and the University of Corsica Pascal Paoli (UCPP, Corsica, France).It is chaired by Prof. Viviana Re and Dr. Maria di Rosa (UNIPI), Prof.\u00a0Sebastien Santoni and Dr. Thomas Leydier (UNICPP), with the help of Dr.\u00a0Stefano Viaroli (UNIPI), Dr. Emilie Garel, Prof. Frederic Huneau, Prof.\u00a0Vanina Pasqualini and with the support of the University of Corsica Pascal\u00a0Paoli. Students will be hosted\u00a0at the University of Corsica, Corte, France. To learn more about the\u00a0University of Corsica Pascal Paoli\u00a0please check the following\u00a0website,\u00a0brochure\u00a0and\u00a0video. The Summer School will be articulated in 5 days, according to the program available for download at the bottom of the webpage. Aim The interdisciplinary summer school proposes a novel and integrated approach to understand the past, present, and future of water resources through the lens of structural geology, geochemistry, and socio-hydrogeology. Thanks to hands-on field and laboratory experiences the summer school will provide participants an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of the main disciplines necessary to characterize water quality and quantity and to translate this information into management proposals for the long-term protection of this resource. After the course participants will be able to plan integrated monitoring\u00a0assessment, use in situ monitoring probes, correctly store and preserve\u00a0samples for chemical and isotopic analyses. Participants will learn to\u00a0identify the main geological structures in the study area, collect and store\u00a0samples and deepen their understanding of water-rock interaction\u00a0processes in wetlands and Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs). Who can apply MSc students,\u00a0PhD candidates and early-stage researchers in Geology, Environmental Sciences or similar fields; professionals in the related field. Language English Program Intensity Full-time Application Admission Requirements Being MSc students,\u00a0PhD candidates and early-stage researchers in Geology, Environmental Sciences or similar fields.

These threats include both shortlived\u00a0processes (e.g. over pumping and contamination) and long-term ones\u00a0(e.g. climate change) and require sound scientific knowledge to implement\u00a0sustainable protection measures.For this reason, the Summer School will cover different topics necessary to\u00a0better asses the intricate relationships between the geosphere,\u00a0hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere, for a comprehensive\u00a0characterization of GDEs, including: Hydrogeochemistry (gas and physicochemical parameters): to evaluate groundwater natural composition and assess deviations from natural baseline values; Structural geology: to better assess the geometry of groundwater flow path; Isotope hydrology:\u00a0to trace groundwater recharge processes and age; Hydrogeology: to identify groundwater flow paths and support geochemical pieces of evidence on water-rock interaction and mixing processes with surface water to complement vulnerability assessments; Socio-hydrogeology: to assess the socio-economic impact of mineral and thermal waters, and to understand how to effectively translate scientific outcomes to the water users; Ecology:\u00a0to analyse biodiversity and ecological processes towards\u00a0innovative solutions for GDEs restoration, combining both natural and\u00a0social sciences. The school will take place in Corsica, a unique place for testing integrated\u00a0approaches, characterized by the presence of a multi-composite\u00a0geological and hydroclimatic context, giving origin to various GDEs.Indeed, as a Mediterranean mountainous Island, the Corsica is well known\u00a0as a biodiversity and geo-diversity hotspot, hosting 220 Km\u00b2 of wetlands\u00a0and GDEs: coastal lagoons, alluvial wetlands, river banks and mouths,\u00a0temporary ponds, low and high-altitude peatlands. Most of them are of\u00a0high heritage value, and 5 of them are listed as RAMSAR sites: Biguglia,\u00a0Urbino, the Palo coastal lagoons, the Tre Padule de Suartone temporary\u00a0pond, and the Moltifao peatland. Even if Corsica\u2019s wetlands appear\u00a0obviously groundwater-dependent considering the Mediterranean\u00a0hydroclimate context, recent scientific publications allowed a better\u00a0characterization and quantification of catchment water balance\u00a0components supplying Corsican GDEs over time and space. Integrated geological and environmental tools are very interesting when\u00a0used together because they can provide information on water origins and\u00a0chemical properties, as well as an estimation of the timing of the hydroecological\u00a0processes. Especially, considering the steep relief and geology\u00a0diversity of the Corsica Island, environmental stable and radioactive\u00a0natural tracers seem well adapted for functional and qualitative\u00a0assessment of hydrological fluxes supplying GDEs. Like many coastal areas in the Mediterranean, the Corsica Island is under an\u00a0increasing pressure from the combined effects of climate change,\u00a0population growth, agriculture, and tourism. Then, surface and\u00a0groundwater flows can also become sources of pollutants and\u00a0contaminants, linking GDEs to all human activities in the catchment area,\u00a0and increasing GDEs qualitative vulnerability. In this context, the Summer School aims at giving key scientific concepts and practical tools to increase\u00a0and disseminate knowledge on GDEs functioning, and rise innovative ideas\u00a0for a sustainable use and management combining both natural and social\u00a0sciences.More broadly, the Summer School will offer a unique opportunity tovcombine foundational and applied geological knowledge with\u00a0interdisciplinary learning, enhance field and lab skills, explore academic\u00a0pathways at UCPP and UNIPI, connect research with professional\u00a0opportunities, engage in language practice and cultural exchange, expand\u00a0international networks, and promote lifelong learning. The Summer School is jointly organised by the University of Pisa (UNIPI,\u00a0Italy) and the University of Corsica Pascal Paoli (UCPP, Corsica, France).It is chaired by Prof. Viviana Re and Dr. Maria di Rosa (UNIPI), Prof.\u00a0Sebastien Santoni and Dr. Thomas Leydier (UNICPP), with the help of Dr.\u00a0Stefano Viaroli (UNIPI), Dr. Emilie Garel, Prof. Frederic Huneau, Prof.\u00a0Vanina Pasqualini and with the support of the University of Corsica Pascal\u00a0Paoli. Students will be hosted\u00a0at the University of Corsica, Corte, France. To learn more about the\u00a0University of Corsica Pascal Paoli\u00a0please check the following\u00a0website,\u00a0brochure\u00a0and\u00a0video. The Summer School will be articulated in 5 days, according to the program available for download at the bottom of the webpage. Aim The interdisciplinary summer school proposes a novel and integrated approach to understand the past, present, and future of water resources through the lens of structural geology, geochemistry, and socio-hydrogeology. Thanks to hands-on field and laboratory experiences the summer school will provide participants an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of the main disciplines necessary to characterize water quality and quantity and to translate this information into management proposals for the long-term protection of this resource. After the course participants will be able to plan integrated monitoring\u00a0assessment, use in situ monitoring probes, correctly store and preserve\u00a0samples for chemical and isotopic analyses. Participants will learn to\u00a0identify the main geological structures in the study area, collect and store\u00a0samples and deepen their understanding of water-rock interaction\u00a0processes in wetlands and Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs).

{"doc_id": "H7qFA3bVHg", "title": "Advanced Techniques for the Analysis of Novel Materials Strategic for Sustainability Transitions: II. Biopolymers", "description": "\u00a0 The Winter School offers a one-week full-time multidisciplinary program\u00a0at the Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department (DCCI) of the\u00a0University of Pisa. It is devoted to training students with a technical-scientific background on the advances of analysing materials of interest in\u00a0environmental and green chemistry. Note that, even if the focus of this year\u00a0is biopolymers, the knowledge acquired during the school may be applied\u00a0to several other materials.\u00a0The focus will be mainly on PhDs, but master\u2019s degrees and post-docs are\u00a0also welcome. The student\u00a0will have access to cutting-edge instrumentation present at DCCI, most of\u00a0which is part of the CISUP,\u00a0the Center for Instrument Sharing of the University of Pisa. These will be: analytical pyrolysis \u2013 gas\u00a0chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) with micro UVirradiator\u00a0systemmicro UVirradiator\u00a0system, Bruker Avance NEO 500 Solid State\u00a0NMR Spectrometer,\u00a0 Thermogravimetric Analyzer-Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometer\u00a0TGA-GC/MS \u2013 TGA8000-Claurus 690 GC/Claurus SQ 8T MS +\u00a0Thermogravimetric Analyzer/Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy\u00a0TGA/FTIR - Q5000 IR (TA Instruments)/Cary 640 (Agilent Technologies). The\u00a0lessons will contain both a theoretical introduction (with a focus on\u00a0applications) and laboratory practice. The curriculum also contains\u00a0explanations on how to critically analyse the data. This program will provide the interested student with detailed information\u00a0on the advanced instrumentation encountered and an overview of the\u00a0potentialities of different approaches to characterise a material. The new\u00a0skills will be precious for the educational background of the student, who\u00a0will primarily be a Chemistry student but may also be of Chemical\u00a0Engineering and other technical-scientific areas. The Winter School will be held on campus in Pisa, at\u00a0Dipartimemto di Chimica e Chimica Industriale, Via G. Moruzzi,13. Aim This program aims to offer access to different advanced instrumentation\u00a0and to help the student understand the potentialities of this peculiar\u00a0equipment and of a multi-technique approach to characterise a material of\u00a0interest. It will enhance the ability to face challenges concerning the\u00a0characterisation of materials. This skill is crucial in the frame of the main\u00a0pillars of nowadays research, so often connected with new materials for\u00a0the environment and green chemistry. Who can apply Firstly PhD students but master's degree students and post-docs are also\u00a0welcome. Language English Program Intensity Full-time Application Admission Requirements Bachelor's degree in technical-scientific areas. The participant should be\u00a0enrolled in a research institution.

{"doc_id": "aE2NTaWu2H", "title": "Meals", "description": "The University of Pisa offers a low-price dining service to students through the Diritto allo Studio Universitario (DSU Toscana) agency. In Pisa, there are five dining halls that may be accessible to students enrolled. In order to access the university canteens you must have a temporary canteen card that can be obtained at the canteens themselves, or the student card given to the student along with the exam booklet. In order to use in the canteens, the card must be activated online or alternatively at the canteen card offices: all information regarding costs and the application for reduced costs are available on the dedicated webpage. The temporary canteen card can only be used in the canteens. The Student Card is a magnetic card which allows those who attend any of the universities in Tuscany, to access all the services offered by the DSU, regardless of which university they are enrolled at.

{"doc_id": "mtCW8QwNMK", "title": "Support services", "description": "Counseling services Entry into University and higher education is an important life-experience as it represents a decisive step towards achieving independence and reaching maturity. The transfer into university study can therefore be daunting and some students may find themselves confronted by certain problems. We want our students to have the most fulfilling and pleasant university experience possible, and so, for this reason, the University of Pisa runs a counselling service (\"Servizio di Ascolto e Consulenza\") which is offered to all students. This service is available to those that want to resolve any specific issues or simply talk to someone. Who can use the service? The counselling service is aimed at students who are struggling to deal with any problems linked to their university experience, for instance issues relating to: Adapting to university study and life; Time management and organisation of study methods; Relationships with colleagues and professors; Concentration, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness and lack of motivation. Purposes of the service The purpose of this service is to provide students with the help and support of experienced and qualified professionals, who will help them to understand, confront and overcome their difficulties by: Providing a listening space where students can feel at ease; Developing appropriate strategies to help students manage any discomforts regarding their university experience; Helping students to discover ways of handling their problems in an independent manner. Organisation of the service Students interested in these support services can choose to receive either individual support or group support. Individual support involves attending a short series of 45-minute sessions hosted by one of our professionals. During these meetings, our professional counsellors will listen to any concerns communicated by our students and then identify ways of dealing with these issues. They will provide effective support and encourage students to become more self-aware. Group support involves attending 8 weekly 90-minute sessions. During these meetings, different coping strategies will be discussed, including ways of: handling anxiety, easing emotional discomfort, improving social and interpersonal skills and generally supporting psychological well-being in order to have a better quality of life. How can I book an appointment? Students who are interested in getting involved must first complete a brief online questionnaire, in order to evaluate which type of support (individual or group) is most suitable for them. Students will receive an email with details of the recommended route based on the questionnaire results, and information on booking an appointment. Students who are advised to seek individual support can book their first appointment online by accessing our virtual help desk and clicking \"Accesso all'area riservata\". You should login using the same credentials as those used for the Alice Portal, and then click \"Prenotazione appuntamenti\", followed by \"Servizio di ascolto e consulenza psicologia\". Students will then be able to choose the day and time of their appointment in the electronic calendar. Students will be able to book more appointments directly with our counsellors rather than online after they've had their first meeting.

In a number of cases, learning disorders such as these are misinterpreted as a lack of interest and motivation on the student's behalf. This can often have a negative impact on the student's academic career and his/her self-esteem, and therefore limit the student's personal development. We at the University of Pisa want all of our students to benefit from and enjoy their time studying with us. For this reason, we have a \"Welcome Project\" in which experienced staff from the USID (Unit\u00e0 di Servizi per l'Integrazione degli studenti Disabili/Service Unit for the Integration of Special Needs students) assists students with learning disorders in planning and organising their studies at the University of Pisa. Such assistance includes offering students a mediation service for written and oral exams with professors, and providing specific tutoring for academic activities such as taking class notes and recording lessons. The project also offers: Information on the enrolment procedure and admission exams; Individual meetings for academic guidance; Diagnosis and a detailed updated certification for students who may not have an official diagnosis or may not be in possession of an updated diagnosis (i.e. more than 3 years).

They will provide effective support and encourage students to become more self-aware. Group support involves attending 8 weekly 90-minute sessions. During these meetings, different coping strategies will be discussed, including ways of: handling anxiety, easing emotional discomfort, improving social and interpersonal skills and generally supporting psychological well-being in order to have a better quality of life. How can I book an appointment? Students who are interested in getting involved must first complete a brief online questionnaire, in order to evaluate which type of support (individual or group) is most suitable for them. Students will receive an email with details of the recommended route based on the questionnaire results, and information on booking an appointment. Students who are advised to seek individual support can book their first appointment online by accessing our virtual help desk and clicking \"Accesso all'area riservata\". You should login using the same credentials as those used for the Alice Portal, and then click \"Prenotazione appuntamenti\", followed by \"Servizio di ascolto e consulenza psicologia\". Students will then be able to choose the day and time of their appointment in the electronic calendar. Students will be able to book more appointments directly with our counsellors rather than online after they've had their first meeting.

In a number of cases, learning disorders such as these are misinterpreted as a lack of interest and motivation on the student's behalf. This can often have a negative impact on the student's academic career and his/her self-esteem, and therefore limit the student's personal development. We at the University of Pisa want all of our students to benefit from and enjoy their time studying with us. For this reason, we have a \"Welcome Project\" in which experienced staff from the USID (Unit\u00e0 di Servizi per l'Integrazione degli studenti Disabili/Service Unit for the Integration of Special Needs students) assists students with learning disorders in planning and organising their studies at the University of Pisa. Such assistance includes offering students a mediation service for written and oral exams with professors, and providing specific tutoring for academic activities such as taking class notes and recording lessons. The project also offers: Information on the enrolment procedure and admission exams; Individual meetings for academic guidance; Diagnosis and a detailed updated certification for students who may not have an official diagnosis or may not be in possession of an updated diagnosis (i.e. more than 3 years). If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us (see below).
