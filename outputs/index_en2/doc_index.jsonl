Furthermore the University has close relations with the Pisan Institutes of the National Board of Research, with many cultural institutions of national and international importance, and with industries, especially those based in information technology, which went through a phase of rapid expansion in Pisa during the nineteen sixties and seventies. The University of Pisa was officially established in 1343, although a number of scholars claim its origin dates back to the 11th century. The earliest evidence of a Pisan \"Studium\" dates back to 1338, when the renowned jurist Ranieri Arsendi transferred to Pisa from Bologna. He along with Bartolo Da Sassoferrato, a lecturer in Civil Law, were paid by the Municipality to teach public lessons. The papal bull 'In supremae dignitatis', granted by Pope Clement VI on 3 September 1343, recognized the 'Studium' of Pisa as a 'Studium Generale'; an institution of further education founded or confirmed by a universal authority, the Papacy or Empire. Pisa was one of the first European universities that received this papal attestation, which guaranteed the universal, legal value of its educational qualifications. The subjects taught first were: Theology, Civil Law, Canon Law and Medicine. In 1355 Francesco Da Buti, the well-known commentator of Dante's Divine Comedy, began teaching at the \"Studium\". Pisa and its \"Studium\" underwent a period of crisis around the turn of the 15th century: the Florentines' conquering of the town ruined its economic and social life. However, there is a lack of documented evidence on the University's regular functioning for decades. In 1473, thanks to Lorenzo dei Medici, the Pisan Studium resumed its systematic development and the construction of a building for holding lessons was built in 1486. The building - later known as Palazzo della Sapienza (The Building of Knowledge) - was located in the fourteenth-century Piazza del Grano. The image of a cherub was placed Above the Gate 'Dell'Abbondanza' (the Gate of Abundance), leading to the Piazza, which is still today the symbol of the University. Following the rebellion against Florence in 1494 and the war following, the Pisan Studium suffered a period of decline, and was transferred to Pistoia, Prato and Florence. The ceremonial re-opening of the University, on 1 November 1543, occurred under the rule of Duke Cosimo I dei Medici, who was considered as a second inauguration. The statute of 1545 improved the quality of the University and the Pisan Athenaeum became one of the most notorious in Europe for teaching and research. Luca Ghini held the chair of \"Semplici\" (Botany), and was the founder of the world's first Botanical Gardens, succeeded by Andrea Cesalpino, who pioneered the first scientific methodology for the classification of plants and is considered a forerunner in the discovery of blood circulation. Gabriele Fallopio and Marcello Malpighi lectured in Anatomy and Medicine. Galileo Galilei, who was born and studied in Pisa, became a professor of Mathematics at the Pisan Studium in 1589. The University's role as a state institution became even more noticeable during the Medici Grand Duchy period. A protectionist policy ensured that there were a consistent number of scholars and teachers: laws issued by Cosimo I, Ferdinando I and Ferdinando II obliged those who intended to obtain a degree to attend the Studium of Pisa. This period sees various illustrious figures lecture at Pisa, especially in the field of law and medicine. The University's development continued under the dynasty of Lorenas. They completed the construction of the astronomic observatory (a project initiated by the Medicis), as well as enriching the University Library with important publications, developing the Botanical Gardens and Natural Science Museum and they established new chairs, such as Experimental Physics and Chemistry.  The annexation of Tuscany to the Napoleonic Empire resulted in the transformation of the Studium into an Imperial Academy: the Athenaeum became a branch of the University of Paris and the courses and study programs were structured following the French public education model. Five new faculties were established (Theology, Law, Medicine, Science and Literature), along with examinations, different qualification titles and graduation theses. In 1813 'La Scuola Normale Superiore' was established, as a branch of the 'Ecole Normale de Paris'. The Restoration wasn't able to erase the effects of the Napoleonic experience. The first Congress of Italian Scientists was held in Pisa in 1839. 421 scientists and over 300 experts of various disciplines discussed zoology, comparative anatomy, chemistry, physics, mathematics, agronomy, technology, botany, vegetation physiology, geology, mineralogy, geography and medicine. In 1839 - 1840 the Director of Education, Gaetano Giorgini, brought about the most important reform in the University of Pisa by raising the number of faculties to six (Theology, Law, Literature, Medicine, Mathematics and Natural Sciences) and created the world's first chair of Agriculture and sheep farming. In 1846 the Scuola Normale was re-opened. Meanwhile, liberal and patriotic ideals were spreading at Athenaeum and a battalion of the University - composed of lecturers and students - distinguished itself in the Battle of Curtatone and Montanara in 1848. During the 'Second Restoration', in 1851, Leopoldo II united the universities of Pisa and Siena in a unique Etruscan Athenaeum, which was motivated partly by economic reasons, but primarily for political control. The faculties of Theology and Law rested at Siena; while those of Literature, Medicine, Mathematics and Natural Sciences remained at Pisa. Following the Florentine insurrection and the fleeing of the Grand Duke in 1859, one of the initial measures imposed by the Provisory Government was the restitution to the city of Pisa of its Studium with all six of its faculties.  With the birth of the Kingdom of Italy, the University of Pisa became one of the new state's most prestigious cultural institutions. Between the second half of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries the following prestigious lecturers taught at Pisa: the lawyers Francesco Carrara and Francesco Buonamici, philologists Domenico Comparetti and Giovanni D'Ancona, historians Pasquale Villari, Gioacchino Volpe and Luigi Russo, philosopher Giovanni Gentile, economist Giuseppe Toniolo and mathematicians Ulisse Dini and Antonio Pacinotti. The first European institute of Historical Linguistics was founded in Pisa in 1890.  During the years of fascism the Pisa Athenaeum was an active centre for political debate and antifascist organisation.  After the Second World War the University of Pisa returned to the avant-garde in many fields of knowledge. During the 1900s, the University continued to grow and the Engineering and Pharmacy faculties, were established before the war, and then after the Second World War the Economics, Foreign Languages and Literature and Politics faculties were established. In 1967 the 'Scuola Superiore di Studi Universitari e Perfezionamento S. Anna' was founded which, together with 'La Scuola Normale', formed a highly prestigious learning and teaching centre.", "lang": "en"}, "1028": {"doclen": 720, "url": "https://www.unipi.it/index.php/history?tmpl=component&amp;print=1", "title": "The University of Pisa and its history", "description": "The University of Pisa is a public institution with twenty departments, and high level research centres in the agriculture, astrophysics, computer science, engineering, medicine and veterinary medicine sectors.

Institutional roles During his career, Professor Mancarella has covered numerous important institutional roles both within the University of Pisa and at national level. He was Deputy Head of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences from 2006 to 2010 and Vice Rector to Teaching from 2010 to 2016. From 1999 to 2016, he was the Rector’s Delegate in the function of coordination, supervision and support of all those activities concerning the integration of students with disabilities. He was also Head of the Unit for the support and integration of students with disabilities (USID). Between 2009 and 2015, he was President of the National University Conference for Disability Delegates (CNUDD). Scientific and teaching activities Professor Mancarella’s teaching activities have been mainly within the field of the core learning activities for the degrees in Computer Science and Informatics. He was Head of the Operative Unit of the Department of Computer Science for two regional projects aimed at developing multimedia learning centres and the use of innovative teleformation methodologies for staff training.On the research side, Professor Mancarella started from the analysis of the declarative programming language for knowledge representation. He then expanded his interest to the broader theme of computational logic, studying innovative models and language for intelligent systems based on logic, able to endow artificial systems with a capacity for reasoning which is not only deductive but also hypothetical and predictive. In more recent years, his research has been aimed at the so-called logic-based argumentation systems through studies of a theoretical and foundational nature, but with an emphasis still on the computational and applicative aspects. These were central themes in two European projects: SOCS (SOcieties of ComputeeS, 5TH Framework Program, 2002-2004) and ARGUGRID (ARGUmentation as a foundation for the semantic GRID, 6th Framework Program, 2006-2009).Other research themes developed by Paolo Mancarella are concerned with the static analysis of concurrent languages, temporal reasoning, the integration of functional and logic programming paradigms and the development of prediction systems for people with disabilities.

In more recent years, his research has been aimed at the so-called logic-based argumentation systems through studies of a theoretical and foundational nature, but with an emphasis still on the computational and applicative aspects. These were central themes in two European projects: SOCS (SOcieties of ComputeeS, 5TH Framework Program, 2002-2004) and ARGUGRID (ARGUmentation as a foundation for the semantic GRID, 6th Framework Program, 2006-2009).Other research themes developed by Paolo Mancarella are concerned with the static analysis of concurrent languages, temporal reasoning, the integration of functional and logic programming paradigms and the development of prediction systems for people with disabilities.

Scientific and teaching activities Professor Passalacqua’s teaching activity has always been within the two degree courses at the Department of Law (Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Business, Labour and Administrative Law) and deals with the public regulation of markets. She is the author of two monographs on the subject of public supervision of company activity and over sixty publications. Her first book deals with administrative inspections: it presents a possible typification, in order to reconstruct the relationship with the function and highlights the often precautional and in particular discretional nature, and it illustrates the contradictions that positive law presents on the subject of the guarantee and safeguard of the private individuals inspected. The second monograph is a marked criticism of the present model of public regulation of financial markets, uncovering alternative and more efficient means, capable of enhancing what the conservative regulations have always ignored, but which instead are a typical element of today’s banking and financial markets: uncertainty. In these terms, rules following the principals of precaution are identified, where the level of public intervention is graded according to the differing level of uncertainty linked to the activity regulated. Further research interests are mainly in public finance law, and more specifically in the process of expense revision and its effect on the managerial phase of public services; the structure and discipline of state-controlled companies; the relationship between law, economics and public interest.

He graduated in Computer Science at the University of Pisa in 1982 and gained a joint Ph.D. in Information Technology from the Universities of Genoa, Pisa and Udine in 1988. After a period at the Imperial College of Science in London, he returned to the University of Pisa initially as a researcher, then associate professor and finally from 2004 as a full professor in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Paolo Mancarella is married and has two children. Institutional roles During his career, Professor Mancarella has covered numerous important institutional roles both within the University of Pisa and at national level. He was Deputy Head of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences from 2006 to 2010 and Vice Rector to Teaching from 2010 to 2016. From 1999 to 2016, he was the Rector’s Delegate in the function of coordination, supervision and support of all those activities concerning the integration of students with disabilities. He was also Head of the Unit for the support and integration of students with disabilities (USID). Between 2009 and 2015, he was President of the National University Conference for Disability Delegates (CNUDD). Scientific and teaching activities Professor Mancarella’s teaching activities have been mainly within the field of the core learning activities for the degrees in Computer Science and Informatics. He was Head of the Operative Unit of the Department of Computer Science for two regional projects aimed at developing multimedia learning centres and the use of innovative teleformation methodologies for staff training.On the research side, Professor Mancarella started from the analysis of the declarative programming language for knowledge representation. He then expanded his interest to the broader theme of computational logic, studying innovative models and language for intelligent systems based on logic, able to endow artificial systems with a capacity for reasoning which is not only deductive but also hypothetical and predictive. In more recent years, his research has been aimed at the so-called logic-based argumentation systems through studies of a theoretical and foundational nature, but with an emphasis still on the computational and applicative aspects. These were central themes in two European projects: SOCS (SOcieties of ComputeeS, 5TH Framework Program, 2002-2004) and ARGUGRID (ARGUmentation as a foundation for the semantic GRID, 6th Framework Program, 2006-2009).Other research themes developed by Paolo Mancarella are concerned with the static analysis of concurrent languages, temporal reasoning, the integration of functional and logic programming paradigms and the development of prediction systems for people with disabilities.

The primary objective of the Moroccan universities is to develop teaching and research internationalization; moreover, they have adopted the ECTS system. With this project, the Tunisian universities wanted to strengthen cooperation with the University of Pisa in various fields: UCAR in rural engineering, UTM in biotechnology and UNIV-K in business and management.As far as Canada is concerned, University of Calgary UCalgary and York University YU were involved to strengthen collaboration with UNIPI in biology and computer studies.

Can I carry on my mobility from my home country on distance learning mode? Yes you can, provided your sending institution agrees. The University of Pisa is currently offering all its courses on distance learning mode. In case you need further details on the classes you are attending, you can also arrange distance- meetings with your teachers. Although unpredictable being the time, we hope that the summer exams session will take place in presence. We warmly recommend you to plan with your teachers the exam session mode. 2. While attending my courses on distance learning mode, will my Erasmus grant be preserved? Yes, it will. The European Commission recently resolved that the Erasmus grants will be preserved even if students are attending their courses on distance learning mode (https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/resources/coronavirus-impact_en). Nonetheless, please contact your sending institution to know the exact procedure it requires. 3.

While attending my courses on distance learning mode in my home country and thus carrying on my mobility virtually, which mobility documents will I have? Will I have my certificate of arrival/departure? In case you are staying in your home country but still attending the University of Pisa courses, you are still performing your mobility, although on virtual mode. During this period is not foreseen an \"End of Mobility\" certificate nor a “Learning Agreement After the Mobility” in case you are an Erasmus student. All final certificates will be provided for when you will effectively end your mobility. Nevertheless, in case you need it, we can provide you with a certification stating you are not staying in Pisa anymore. To this end, please forward all documents proving your journey back home (flight/train/ferry tickets). 5. In case I returned to my home country, and I am not attending the distance learning at the University of Pisa, which mobility documents will I have? In case you returned to your home country and you are not attending the University of Pisa courses on distance learning mode, it is like you interrupted your mobility. You will be then provided with an \"End of Mobility\" certificate that will include the educational activities you performed so far. If you are an Erasmus student, you will be provided with the “Learning Agreement After the Mobility”. 6. In case I interrupted my mobility, can I resume it on next academic year first semester? Yes you can, provided the University of Pisa and your sending institution agree. The final determination is anyway up to your sending institution, to which you should report. 7. In case I want to interrupt my mobility, which procedure should I follow?

It is dedicated to supporting international mobility and cooperation in general, and especially in those macro-regions. It is a partner in the Tuning South-East Asia CBHE (TA-SE).The areas of particular cooperation in Asia is Health in a broad sense, with emphasis on Food Safety, Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences. Thanks to the possibilities offered by KA107 a mobility link has been consolidated, both for those sectors and also other areas of interest for students like Engineering, Economics and Management, ICT. In Asia we have as partners the Royal University of Agriculture in Cambodia, the Savannakhet University in Lao, the Vietnam National University of Agriculture Hanoi in Viet Nam. The partners are involved in the ASEAN Community, but they believe that Erasmus+ mobility with European partners, who can offer high levels of training and collaboration in their fields, can boost their quality and attractiveness internationally. They consider the mobility with the University of Pisa suitable for building up and consolidating networks and cooperation capabilities. In Mongolia we have 3 partners: the National University of Mongolia (NUM), the Mongolian University of Life Sciences (MULS), and the Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST). NUM’s strategy includes networking with important universities around the world. It counts links with 129 universities and is a member of the IAU (International Association of Universities). It consolidated its existing collaboration with UNIPI through Erasmus+ mobility. MULS focuses on education, research, and innovation in its field. It strengthened relations with UNIPI to enhance academic and cultural exchanges. MUST’s internationalization strategy was to increase mobility with Western European Universities. It was the first university in Mongolia to implement a Credit Based System in its activities. In 2016 we improved the mobility of students and staff from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.The International University of Kyrgyzstan and the Naryn State University have with UNIPI long-term agreements for proactive collaboration in HE reform, enhancement and research. All the requested flows have been completed. In Uzbekistan we implemented the mobility with 7 Uzbek Universities including both general and thematically focused universities, chosen because of their efficiency and commitment: Andijan State University (ASU), Bukhara State University (BSU), Namangan State University (NamSU), Namangan Institute of Engineering (NIET), Samarkand Agricultural Institute (SamAI), Tashkent Pediatric Medical Institute (TPMI) and Tashkent State Agrarian University (TSAU). Among ENI South countries we have Egypt (Alexandria University and Suez Canal University), Israel (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Morocco (Cadi Ayyad University). In Serbia we have as partner the University of Novi Sad. It participated in 16 Erasmus Mundus projects for the region between 2008-2015 becoming one of the most valuable Western Balkans partners to EU universities. The success of the mobility implemented with UNIPI under the first KA107 call has been evaluated very positively and has improved the participation in the mobility. The partners agreed to ask for support for incoming MA and Doctoral students, for six months in Kyrgyzstan, Lao, Vietnam, Cambodia and Egypt; for all cycles students in Mongolia, Morocco, Israel and Serbia; for PhD for 3 months in Uzbekistan; one or two incoming training or teaching staff and one outgoing teaching staff for a brief period (5 days, eight hours minimum of teaching). We completed 104 exchange mobilities of incoming students and staff and outgoing teaching staff.The impact includes the improvement of the international attractiveness and the enhancement of the Partners’ role at regional level. The preparation of capacity building projects and cooperation for the development of higher education in the disciplinary areas involved, and the enhancement of the capacity for international networking of universities and staff ensure long-term impact.

This network is a result of the extension to new teaching areas of the existing agreements yielding positive results of interest to students.Furthermore, the University of Pisa has increased its presence in the Erasmus + Mobility programme with its well-established participation in the Consorzio Traineeship (Traineeship Consortium), coordinated by the University of Padua.The university has established tactics aimed at encouraging mobility and enabling an ever increasing number of students to make the most of the opportunities offered by the Erasmus + programme.For this purpose, the university has allocated a budget to co-finance the EU Erasmus funding and to integrate it, and it has created a Portal for both incoming and outgoing Erasmus students (ErasmusManager). This is intended to facilitate the mobility-related procedures for students, for the professors coordinating internationalisation (CAI) and for the administrative staff who deal with mobility.As for the number of participants, we have effected a total of 743 student mobilities (for both study and traineeship purposes), 38% of which are traineeships. Indeed, this type of mobility has prompted an 11% increase in traineeship mobility compared to the previous year.In addition, in order to support the mobility of students with special needs, a special service has been set up, in collaboration with the Services Unit dedicated to the integration of students with disabilities – USID. This provides these students with a personalised support system according to their specific needs, including the filling out of their application for ad hoc EU funding.As part of its policy to promote the integration of refugees in the education and training system, throughout the academic year 2016/2017 the university applied for and obtained 5 OLS licenses, which were assigned to several students singled out through collaboration with the local Italian Red Cross. A special meeting was organized with refugees and Red Cross volunteers to illustrate the opportunity of language learning offered by the university through the OLS. In order to overcome logistical and technical difficulties for the effective use of the licences, the university has been working to ensure that the students have access to its WIFI network and to its equipped computer stations thanks to the collaboration with the university’s Linguistic Centre (CLI), which has made available its staff and workers.The main goals of our university are to encourage incoming and outgoing student and staff mobility, to increase the number of programmes offered in English and to increase the mobility of non-teaching staff, whose training is particularly important to provide the appropriate administrative support for internationalization.For this purpose our University has organized two Staff Training Weeks focused on: “Best practises on Internationalization” attended by several colleagues from different european countries.

Through the research work carried out in particular by the labour market Observatory of the University of Padua, we are able to understand better these needs and one of the key demands by companies is to have graduates able to work in international contexts, able to work using foreign languages and to network also at a transnational level.The project addressed students of all the disciplines with a greater attention to students in social, political sciences and humanities, who usually encounter more difficulties in entering the world of work and need to have in their curriculum some qualified international traineeship experiences, to increase their employability.During the academic year 2016/17 the Consortium organised 219 traineeship mobilities, and 185 were funded with Erasmus funds.The traineeships have had an average duration of three months and 17 days and took place mainly in hosting partners such as: language schools, law firms, consultancy firms, local bodies, corporations, banks, chambers of Commerce, international foundations, museums, libraries, NGOs, research institutes and universities.Hosting partners were 195 in 25 different countries. 69 participants were recent graduates.Most of the participants considered that the training activities were relevant and in line with their educational programme and would work in the hosting organization if they had the chance. Almost all participants are satisfied with the mobility experience.More than half of the participants said they could not face the mobility experience without the grant, and this gives an idea of the importance of the program for the students, for the enrichment of their training path and for the fundamental contribution that the program gives to internationalization of curricula.As for the qualitative objectives of internships, participants generally have acquired the skills and competencies that had been foreseen in the learning agreements.The skills were those required by companies working in a globalised context: skills related to the use of foreign languages in the workplace, hard skills related to the study course, but above all soft skills such as communication, networking, problem-solving skills.By analyzing the participants report we can see that more than 90% of the participants thinks their problem solving skills are improved, they have learned better how to plan and carry out their learning independently, learned better how to see the value of different cultures, they are more able to cooperate with people from other backgrounds and cultures, and they know better their strengths and weaknesses. The majority of the participants found that their language proficiency in a foreign language has improved during the mobility.The absolute majority of participants believe that they will have more opportunities to find a job after the mobility, they have clearer ideas about their professional goals, and almost all participants would like to work in an international environment.

They found also that the language proficiency in a foreign language have improved during their mobility.As for the qualitative objectives of internships, participants generally have acquired the skills and competencies that had been foreseen in the learning agreements. The skills were those required by companies working in a globalised context: skills related to the use of foreign languages in the workplace, hard skills related to the study course, but above all soft skills such as communication, networking, problem-solving skills. By analyzing the participant reports and hosting institutions evaluations, we can see that participants could benefit from an overall strengthening of employability and of their career prospects because of the improvement or acquisition of hard, soft and language skills, and through increased proactivity, sense of initiative and intercultural awareness.

These students acquire knowledge in professions such as technician of restoration of architectural elements and technician of wood technology.The appointed students took part in a two-week placement (apprenticeship), which was held in Pisa (Italy). These students worked on the project in laboratories of the Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department, University of Pisa and participated in restoration of frescoes in Campo Santo, which allowed to get to know modern research methods of wood and familiarization with the techniques of restoration at the highest level.The project lasted from 01.06.2017 to 31.05.2019. The project partner was Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department, University of Pisa.Our project fitted very well in the European growth strategy ‘Europa 2020’, and it is also consistent with the educational policy of our province, city and school. Taking into consideration the growing importance of youth’s mobility flow and the care of vocational education, we were undertaking actions which encouraged students to cooperate with foreign partners. The aim of the project was to support students in acquiring professional and social competences through getting familiar with new technologies related with renovation of monuments and to strengthen both multicultural bonds and to respect mutually completed work. Thanks to the participation in this project our teachers got familiar with one of the European technical languages well enough to enable basic communication. Moreover, another aim of the project was to raise the European dimension of vocational school through starting cooperation with foreign job market and the institutions of higher education. The teachers who took part in the project together with the students, gained additional experience in setting and realising practical trainings in restoration of architectural elements and properties of wood using the latest techniques, and in particular the knowledge of innovative solutions for maintenance of monuments.Our students, by gaining their first professional experience abroad, increased their knowledge, qualifications essential in their profession skills, which are directly related with new techniques used in the restoration, knowledge of innovative solutions applied to study properties of wood and practical skills of conservation usage.Methodology used for project purposes consisted of few stages which played an important part and also determined the project’s success. Methodology embraced all the actions undertaken by the project partners, namely, activities that enabled the participants for mobility, attractive practical trainings, professional and cultural trips as well as monitoring evaluation and dissemination. Completing practical trainings in renovation in Italy let our students become familiar with solutions met in renovator’s and wood technologist’s work other than the ones in Poland. As for social competences, our students learned from each other. They practiced also the ability to cooperate and to share gained knowledge. It had and will have its impact on limiting the number of students finishing their education too early. The direct results also involved knowledge of tradition, history, culture and Italian architecture. It will later become the sense of the European togetherness. The long-term results will be tightly connected with vocational and social competences of our students. Serving the apprenticeship abroad developed the spirit of enterprise, quick reaction to work market changes and strengthened self esteem through overcoming personal weaknesses. It developed also faith in individual development possibilities which will have a great impact on active and effective motion within the European work market. The predicted long-term and permanent influence of school’s actions on its graduate’s profile will be a potentially successful, well-educated and socially active worker who will not be endangered by poverty or social elimination.

These students worked on the project in laboratories of the Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department, University of Pisa and participated in restoration of frescoes in Campo Santo, which allowed to get to know modern research methods of wood and familiarization with the techniques of restoration at the highest level.The project lasted from 01.06.2017 to 31.05.2019. The project partner was Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department, University of Pisa.Our project fitted very well in the European growth strategy ‘Europa 2020’, and it is also consistent with the educational policy of our province, city and school. Taking into consideration the growing importance of youth’s mobility flow and the care of vocational education, we were undertaking actions which encouraged students to cooperate with foreign partners. The aim of the project was to support students in acquiring professional and social competences through getting familiar with new technologies related with renovation of monuments and to strengthen both multicultural bonds and to respect mutually completed work. Thanks to the participation in this project our teachers got familiar with one of the European technical languages well enough to enable basic communication. Moreover, another aim of the project was to raise the European dimension of vocational school through starting cooperation with foreign job market and the institutions of higher education. The teachers who took part in the project together with the students, gained additional experience in setting and realising practical trainings in restoration of architectural elements and properties of wood using the latest techniques, and in particular the knowledge of innovative solutions for maintenance of monuments.Our students, by gaining their first professional experience abroad, increased their knowledge, qualifications essential in their profession skills, which are directly related with new techniques used in the restoration, knowledge of innovative solutions applied to study properties of wood and practical skills of conservation usage.Methodology used for project purposes consisted of few stages which played an important part and also determined the project’s success. Methodology embraced all the actions undertaken by the project partners, namely, activities that enabled the participants for mobility, attractive practical trainings, professional and cultural trips as well as monitoring evaluation and dissemination. Completing practical trainings in renovation in Italy let our students become familiar with solutions met in renovator’s and wood technologist’s work other than the ones in Poland. As for social competences, our students learned from each other. They practiced also the ability to cooperate and to share gained knowledge. It had and will have its impact on limiting the number of students finishing their education too early. The direct results also involved knowledge of tradition, history, culture and Italian architecture. It will later become the sense of the European togetherness. The long-term results will be tightly connected with vocational and social competences of our students. Serving the apprenticeship abroad developed the spirit of enterprise, quick reaction to work market changes and strengthened self esteem through overcoming personal weaknesses. It developed also faith in individual development possibilities which will have a great impact on active and effective motion within the European work market. The predicted long-term and permanent influence of school’s actions on its graduate’s profile will be a potentially successful, well-educated and socially active worker who will not be endangered by poverty or social elimination.

Therefore the Department will forward you the \"Hosting Agreement\", which you will have to sign (two copies) and send back to your host Department in Pisa.

For years, researchers have been wondering about the appearance of   this huge extinct shark that lived about 15-3.6 million years ago, and finally the answer seems to have been found. A new scientific study, in which Dr Alberto Collareta, a palaeontologist at the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Pisa, took part, has shown that the giant shark known by the scientific name of Carcharocles megalodon (or Otodus megalodon) had a slimmer body than previous studies had suggested. “In science fiction novels and movies, the Megalodon is typically portrayed as a monstrous shark of titanic proportions,\" explains Dr Alberto Collareta, the only Italian member of the team of 26 international scientists, who took part in this research. “This is not surprising, since the maximum size of this shark, one of the largest marine predators that has ever existed, is now estimated at around 15-20 metres in total length, and there is little doubt about its hyper-carnivorous diet. “Understanding the biology, evolution and extinction of the Megalodon,\" Dr. Collareta continues, “is important for the significant impact this species had on the ecology and evolution of the marine ecosystems that gave rise to current oceans. However, the fossil record of Megalodon is almost essentially represented by its characteristic huge teeth, while skeletal remains are extremely rare”. The lack of complete Megalodon skeletons has always led researchers to reconstruct the appearance of this ancient giant of the seas by modelling it on that of the current white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). This hypothesis has now been refuted by the study of the international research team of which Collareta is a member and which has recently published a new study in the prestigious international scientific journal Palaeontologia Electronica. This study shows that the Megalodon had a slenderer body shape than the current white shark. “This deduction,” the researcher goes on to explain, “comes from the restudy of an incomplete set of fossil vertebrae belonging to a single specimen of Megalodon discovered in Belgium in the 19th century. In particular, the total body length of that specimen, if estimated on the diameter of the vertebrae of the current white shark, is much less than the length of the incomplete vertebral column alone (9.2 metres vs. 11.1 metres)” “This simple observation,’ Collareta concludes, “strongly suggests that Megalodon was not merely a bulkier version of the modern great white shark, but it was different from the latter in a slenderer physiognomy. Although, in the absence of complete skeletal remains, the exact shape of Megalodon’s body remains uncertain, the results presented in this new research constitute the most cogent empirical evidence for such a shape and represent a significant step towards its reconstruction.

One of the most important tasks is to classify the artefacts, determining chronology, cultural attribution, form, function and other features. Neural networks and deep learning are powerful tools for supporting and facilitating such tasks, often time-consuming and heavily depending on prior knowledge and expertise. The “Neural Networks for Archaeologists, with Python” Winter School illustrates the use of neural networks for analysing and classifying multimodal data, such as images, tables, and texts. It is conducted, with a hands-on approach, through Python, one of the main programming languages of AI and Data Science, including a wide variety of deep learning tools and network architectures. In order to effectively conduct and support the analysis and classification of data coming from tables, images and texts, modern archaeologists should be able to deal with concepts and tools related to these technologies. Such skills are not present in a standard archaeology background, though they are fundamental to effectively nteracting with ICT experts.

The program will be activated also in distance learning mode (TEAMS platform). Aim The Winter School will enable participants to explore and visualize data with Python, set up and train neural networks from scratch and/or by modifying pre-trained networks (transfer learning), in order to perform classification tasks based on images and/or texts.

Our project focuses on Vada Volaterrana, the core of the harbour system of Volterra, one of the most famous Etruscan and Roman cities in Italy. Here, a settlement of considerable interest has been identified in San Gaetano di Vada: it is a port area which has been excavated by the members of the staff and students of the Vada Volaterrana Archaeological Field School. The excavations are part of an interdisciplinary project aimed at defining the paleogeography of the Vada Volaterrana area during Etruscan and Roman times. The project includes paleoenvironmental researches and Ground Penetrating Radar prospections to identify the full extent of the Vada Volaterrana settlement. Moreover, systematic underwater surveys are being conducted in the Vada Volaterrana seabed, in order to identify ancient harbour facilities and enhance our understanding of shipwrecks and underwater findings in the area. Since 2018 the Vada Volaterrana Harbour Project started a partnership with professor Stephen Carmody of Troy University (Alabama) aimed in deepening paleobotanical and environmental features of the area. Flotation of Vada excavated layers provided unexpected and interesting results about landscapes in a diachronical perspective, tree essences and food supply in ancient coastal Etruria. The Summer School will be held on campus in Rosignano M.mo (LIvorno), Frazione Vada, Località San Gaetano, via del Porto. Aim The Summer school aims at providing participants with the understanding of the different activities inherent to the job of archaeologist, both in the field and the lab. The Summer School at Vada Volaterrana is an excellent opportunity for students to gain practical experience in archaeological investigation, working side-by-side with skilfull and experienced researchers in the field. The members of the staff will explain how archaeologists work, from the identification of ancient sites through surveys and GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) investigations to the stratigraphic excavation.

There are many hypotheses on the basis of which we try give an answer to the most difficult problems but, wanting to schematize, all can be traced back to two broad categories: those who consider Consciousness entirely reducible to the electro-chemical-physical processes that take place in the brain, and those who don’t grant for such a solution.Sharing the first hypothesis means leaning towards the so-called Scientific Materialism, a monist and reductionist approach to the reality, whereas being sceptical towards this possibility and embracing a non-reductionist perspective can decline in very different options, ranging from dualist approaches, postulating the existence of a proto-psychic substance independent from a physical substratum, to non-substantialist views, suggesting an overall reconsideration of the subject-object relation in order to face the problem of consciousness. This latter hypothesis will be investigated from different perspectives, such as quantum physics, biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, but also and especially from the perspective of contemplative practices. The insights drawn from these fields of enquiry will be thread together within a philosophical framework strongly inspired by phenomenology. In fact two domains that are apparently very different, such as the one of Quantum Physics and the one of meditation and yoga, on the contrary show, through a phenomenological key of understanding, some surprising convergences. The first constitutes the most advanced approach to the study of the physical world, which also extends to phenomena that take place at the nanoscopic level in biological tissues, while the latter allow for a millenarian profound and accurate exploration of issues that are not accessible with objective methods and that concern the first-person experience. Nonetheless when it comes to consciousness they both seem to point towards a similar direction. Moreover, answering the question if Scientific Materialism is capable of embracing the totality of Reality, included consciousness, has a lot to do with what is meant by consciousness and what is meant by cognition. Within ongoing cognitive debate the exploration of consciousness is usually merged and sometimes reduced to the study of the processes through which cognition takes place. But is the mere study of the cognitive faculties sufficient to shed light on the mystery of Consciousness which, itself, is a pre-condition for every single cognition to take place? In order to start tackling these questions, the summer-school is born with a multidisciplinary vocation that brings neurosciences, but also biology, artificial intelligence, and physics in dialogue with epistemological issue at stake in phenomenology and Eastern philosophies and contemplative practice. For this reason the contribution of highly qualified teachers coming from very different backgrounds is required. A specific space will be reserved for the experiential aspect in order to integrate the lessons with familiarization sessions with contemplative practices (Yoga and Meditation). The sessions will be conducted by highly qualified teachers with specific experience and will also be usable by the students who will attend the school online. The 2025 edition of the Summer School Consciousness and Cognition is organized by the University of Pisa in collaboration with the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, with the patronage of the Italian Buddhist Union. The School will take place in a residential form at Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, 35 Km from Pisa, thanks to a convention between the University of Pisa and the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, renowned for the excellent quality of its study programs of Buddhist philosophy and psychology. The program will be activated also in distance learning mode (TEAMS platform).  Aim Philosophy: To acquire sensitivity to the existence of a dimension of consciousness that overcomes the distinction between subject and object and to understand its role in the current quest to explain consciousness, through a progression into insights drawn from Western philosophical approaches (especially phenomenology) and Eastern traditions and practices. Quantum mechanics: To understand the basic principles of quantum mechanics and comprehend the subtler issues connected with the interpretation of the theory and their possible relevance for a discussion of consciousness, of the mind-body problem, and the nature of reality itself. Artificial intelligence and Consciousness: To learn the basic concepts and models of nature-inspired computational techniques and to know how to apply them to a wide range of applications. Students will be exposed to the advantages and challenges of using computationally intelligent systems with human-like capabilities in terms of reasoning, learning, and adaptation. The ethical and social issues arising from the use of robots that mimic the behavior of conscious and aware entities will also be addressed. Biosemiotics: To learn the basics of biosemiotics and become acquainted with the semiotic nature of sign relationships in both biological and human-made systems, understand how cells act as semiotic units capable of interpreting their own environment through sign exchange, and eventually comprehend how sign perception and epigenetic regulation are causally linked through differential gene expression. Contemplative practices: To comprehend the vision of Eastern traditions (Hinduism and Buddhism) concerning consciousness and its different levels and manifestations and to learn the foundations, characteristics, and aspects of the different types of meditation. Neurosciences and non-ordinary states of consciousness: After a description of the neural networks acting in the brain and a survey on the main techniques for investigating brain activity (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), to understand how self induced not ordinary states of consciousness by natural drugs, hypnosis, dream, deep meditation, affect this activity. Practice: To become familiar with the experiential aspects of contemplative practices through meditation and yoga sessions led by highly qualified teachers. Like the rest of the program, these sessions will also be available to online students. Who can apply The program is aimed at all those who are interested in the phenomenon of Consciousness with particular attention, mainly, but not exclusively, to university students of Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, Biology, Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Physics as well as Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists etc. Language English Program Intensity Full-time Application Admission Requirements Students enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's Degree course, or people already in possession of the aforementioned qualifications or equivalent qualifications.

These issues are even more crucial in archaeology because they relate to non-reproducible primary data. In order to effectively retrieve, store, manage, prepare for analysis, and communicate the information and the scientific range of such an amount of data, modern archaeologists should be able to deal with concepts and tools related to new technologies. Such digital competencies are not present in a standard archaeology background, though they are fundamental to interacting with ICT experts effectively. The “R 4 aRchaeologists” Winter School aims for a fruitful combination of archaeology and statistics through the teaching of Data analysis, Data mining, and Data visualisation techniques. It is conducted through R, a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The large amount of data that is produced through archaeological work shows a wide degree of heterogeneity, complexity, and interconnection, making the use of algorithmic methods unavoidable. R is one of the main programming languages of Data Science and includes a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, spatial statistics, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and others.

Attendees will get an introduction to EM fundamentals and then they will learn how to apply those to the design and implementation of future communication systems, radars, wireless sensing systems, wireless networks and high-frequency circuits. The Summer School lectures are subdivided into two parts. The first part is devoted to a concise and basic description of the most important EM phenomena: wave propagation in free space, inhomogeneous media and guiding structures; properties and characteristic parameters of passive devices, transceivers and antennas. Experimental measurements and introduction to commercial EM solvers are also planned. The second part of the lecturers is devoted to highlight how the EM phenomena and devices previously reviewed are applied in some of the most advanced wireless systems. Lecturers, from both academia and ICT industry, will focus on the design criteria, technical features, architectures and innovative aspects directly induced by EM concepts in non-terrestrial networks, 5G mobile communications, wireless power transfer systems, V2X communications, global LEO constellation networks, microwave systems for aerospace and defense. To fully pursue the Summer School goals and provide the most effective outcome, lecturers are selected among academia (University of Pisa and University of Bologna), ICT industry and international research centers. On one day of the Summer School week, the lectures will be given at the Marconi’s Museum in Villa Griffone, Pontecchio Marconi (close to Bologna). In the morning, the attendees will have a guided tour of the museum and see some experiments emulating those made by the pioneer of the radio communications (Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1909) in his family country estate in the late XIX century. In the afternoon, two lecturers on WPT (wireless power transfer) systems and RIS (Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces) for 6G mobile communications will be given by recognized experts from the University of Bologna.

There are many hypotheses on the basis of which we try give an answer to the most difficult problems but, wanting to schematize, all can be traced back to two broad categories: those who consider Consciousness entirely reducible to the electro-chemical-physical processes that take place in the brain, and those who don’t grant for such a solution.Sharing the first hypothesis means leaning towards the so-called Scientific Materialism, a monist and reductionist approach to the reality, whereas being sceptical towards this possibility and embracing a non-reductionist perspective can decline in very different options, ranging from dualist approaches, postulating the existence of a proto-psychic substance independent from a physical substratum, to non-substantialist views, suggesting an overall reconsideration of the subject-object relation in order to face the problem of consciousness. This latter hypothesis will be investigated from different perspectives, such as quantum physics, biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, but also and especially from the perspective of contemplative practices. The insights drawn from these fields of enquiry will be thread together within a philosophical framework strongly inspired by phenomenology. In fact two domains that are apparently very different, such as the one of Quantum Physics and the one of meditation and yoga, on the contrary show, through a phenomenological key of understanding, some surprising convergences. The first constitutes the most advanced approach to the study of the physical world, which also extends to phenomena that take place at the nanoscopic level in biological tissues, while the latter allow for a millenarian profound and accurate exploration of issues that are not accessible with objective methods and that concern the first-person experience. Nonetheless when it comes to consciousness they both seem to point towards a similar direction. Moreover, answering the question if Scientific Materialism is capable of embracing the totality of Reality, included consciousness, has a lot to do with what is meant by consciousness and what is meant by cognition. Within ongoing cognitive debate the exploration of consciousness is usually merged and sometimes reduced to the study of the processes through which cognition takes place. But is the mere study of the cognitive faculties sufficient to shed light on the mystery of Consciousness which, itself, is a pre-condition for every single cognition to take place? In order to start tackling these questions, the summer-school is born with a multidisciplinary vocation that brings neurosciences, but also biology, artificial intelligence, and physics in dialogue with epistemological issue at stake in phenomenology and Eastern philosophies and contemplative practice. For this reason the contribution of highly qualified teachers coming from very different backgrounds is required. A specific space will be reserved for the experiential aspect in order to integrate the lessons with familiarization sessions with contemplative practices (Yoga and Meditation). The sessions will be conducted by highly qualified teachers with specific experience and will also be usable by the students who will attend the school online. The 2025 edition of the Summer School Consciousness and Cognition is organized by the University of Pisa in collaboration with the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, with the patronage of the Italian Buddhist Union. The School will take place in a residential form at Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, 35 Km from Pisa, thanks to a convention between the University of Pisa and the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, renowned for the excellent quality of its study programs of Buddhist philosophy and psychology. The program will be activated also in distance learning mode (TEAMS platform).  Aim Philosophy: To acquire sensitivity to the existence of a dimension of consciousness that overcomes the distinction between subject and object and to understand its role in the current quest to explain consciousness, through a progression into insights drawn from Western philosophical approaches (especially phenomenology) and Eastern traditions and practices. Quantum mechanics: To understand the basic principles of quantum mechanics and comprehend the subtler issues connected with the interpretation of the theory and their possible relevance for a discussion of consciousness, of the mind-body problem, and the nature of reality itself. Artificial intelligence and Consciousness: To learn the basic concepts and models of nature-inspired computational techniques and to know how to apply them to a wide range of applications. Students will be exposed to the advantages and challenges of using computationally intelligent systems with human-like capabilities in terms of reasoning, learning, and adaptation. The ethical and social issues arising from the use of robots that mimic the behavior of conscious and aware entities will also be addressed. Biosemiotics: To learn the basics of biosemiotics and become acquainted with the semiotic nature of sign relationships in both biological and human-made systems, understand how cells act as semiotic units capable of interpreting their own environment through sign exchange, and eventually comprehend how sign perception and epigenetic regulation are causally linked through differential gene expression. Contemplative practices: To comprehend the vision of Eastern traditions (Hinduism and Buddhism) concerning consciousness and its different levels and manifestations and to learn the foundations, characteristics, and aspects of the different types of meditation. Neurosciences and non-ordinary states of consciousness: After a description of the neural networks acting in the brain and a survey on the main techniques for investigating brain activity (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), to understand how self induced not ordinary states of consciousness by natural drugs, hypnosis, dream, deep meditation, affect this activity. Practice: To become familiar with the experiential aspects of contemplative practices through meditation and yoga sessions led by highly qualified teachers. Like the rest of the program, these sessions will also be available to online students. Who can apply The program is aimed at all those who are interested in the phenomenon of Consciousness with particular attention, mainly, but not exclusively, to university students of Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, Biology, Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Physics as well as Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists etc. Language English Program Intensity Full-time Application Admission Requirements Students enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's Degree course, or people already in possession of the aforementioned qualifications or equivalent qualifications.

Within ongoing cognitive debate the exploration of consciousness is usually merged and sometimes reduced to the study of the processes through which cognition takes place. But is the mere study of the cognitive faculties sufficient to shed light on the mystery of Consciousness which, itself, is a pre-condition for every single cognition to take place? In order to start tackling these questions, the summer-school is born with a multidisciplinary vocation that brings neurosciences, but also biology, artificial intelligence, and physics in dialogue with epistemological issue at stake in phenomenology and Eastern philosophies and contemplative practice. For this reason the contribution of highly qualified teachers coming from very different backgrounds is required. A specific space will be reserved for the experiential aspect in order to integrate the lessons with familiarization sessions with contemplative practices (Yoga and Meditation). The sessions will be conducted by highly qualified teachers with specific experience and will also be usable by the students who will attend the school online. The 2025 edition of the Summer School Consciousness and Cognition is organized by the University of Pisa in collaboration with the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, with the patronage of the Italian Buddhist Union. The School will take place in a residential form at Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, 35 Km from Pisa, thanks to a convention between the University of Pisa and the Lama Tzong Khapa Institute, renowned for the excellent quality of its study programs of Buddhist philosophy and psychology. The program will be activated also in distance learning mode (TEAMS platform).  Aim Philosophy: To acquire sensitivity to the existence of a dimension of consciousness that overcomes the distinction between subject and object and to understand its role in the current quest to explain consciousness, through a progression into insights drawn from Western philosophical approaches (especially phenomenology) and Eastern traditions and practices. Quantum mechanics: To understand the basic principles of quantum mechanics and comprehend the subtler issues connected with the interpretation of the theory and their possible relevance for a discussion of consciousness, of the mind-body problem, and the nature of reality itself. Artificial intelligence and Consciousness: To learn the basic concepts and models of nature-inspired computational techniques and to know how to apply them to a wide range of applications. Students will be exposed to the advantages and challenges of using computationally intelligent systems with human-like capabilities in terms of reasoning, learning, and adaptation. The ethical and social issues arising from the use of robots that mimic the behavior of conscious and aware entities will also be addressed. Biosemiotics: To learn the basics of biosemiotics and become acquainted with the semiotic nature of sign relationships in both biological and human-made systems, understand how cells act as semiotic units capable of interpreting their own environment through sign exchange, and eventually comprehend how sign perception and epigenetic regulation are causally linked through differential gene expression. Contemplative practices: To comprehend the vision of Eastern traditions (Hinduism and Buddhism) concerning consciousness and its different levels and manifestations and to learn the foundations, characteristics, and aspects of the different types of meditation. Neurosciences and non-ordinary states of consciousness: After a description of the neural networks acting in the brain and a survey on the main techniques for investigating brain activity (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), to understand how self induced not ordinary states of consciousness by natural drugs, hypnosis, dream, deep meditation, affect this activity. Practice: To become familiar with the experiential aspects of contemplative practices through meditation and yoga sessions led by highly qualified teachers. Like the rest of the program, these sessions will also be available to online students. Who can apply The program is aimed at all those who are interested in the phenomenon of Consciousness with particular attention, mainly, but not exclusively, to university students of Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, Biology, Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Physics as well as Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists etc. Language English Program Intensity Full-time Application Admission Requirements Students enrolled in a Bachelor's or Master's Degree course, or people already in possession of the aforementioned qualifications or equivalent qualifications.

The Mediterranean basin hosts numerous inland and coastal GDE. However – despite their uniqueness – they are increasingly subject to anthropogenic pressures, resulting in degradation of their natural properties. These threats include both shortlived processes (e.g. over pumping and contamination) and long-term ones (e.g. climate change) and require sound scientific knowledge to implement sustainable protection measures.For this reason, the Summer School will cover different topics necessary to better asses the intricate relationships between the geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere, for a comprehensive characterization of GDEs, including: Hydrogeochemistry (gas and physicochemical parameters): to evaluate groundwater natural composition and assess deviations from natural baseline values; Structural geology: to better assess the geometry of groundwater flow path; Isotope hydrology: to trace groundwater recharge processes and age; Hydrogeology: to identify groundwater flow paths and support geochemical pieces of evidence on water-rock interaction and mixing processes with surface water to complement vulnerability assessments; Socio-hydrogeology: to assess the socio-economic impact of mineral and thermal waters, and to understand how to effectively translate scientific outcomes to the water users; Ecology: to analyse biodiversity and ecological processes towards innovative solutions for GDEs restoration, combining both natural and social sciences. The school will take place in Corsica, a unique place for testing integrated approaches, characterized by the presence of a multi-composite geological and hydroclimatic context, giving origin to various GDEs.Indeed, as a Mediterranean mountainous Island, the Corsica is well known as a biodiversity and geo-diversity hotspot, hosting 220 Km² of wetlands and GDEs: coastal lagoons, alluvial wetlands, river banks and mouths, temporary ponds, low and high-altitude peatlands. Most of them are of high heritage value, and 5 of them are listed as RAMSAR sites: Biguglia, Urbino, the Palo coastal lagoons, the Tre Padule de Suartone temporary pond, and the Moltifao peatland. Even if Corsica’s wetlands appear obviously groundwater-dependent considering the Mediterranean hydroclimate context, recent scientific publications allowed a better characterization and quantification of catchment water balance components supplying Corsican GDEs over time and space. Integrated geological and environmental tools are very interesting when used together because they can provide information on water origins and chemical properties, as well as an estimation of the timing of the hydroecological processes. Especially, considering the steep relief and geology diversity of the Corsica Island, environmental stable and radioactive natural tracers seem well adapted for functional and qualitative assessment of hydrological fluxes supplying GDEs. Like many coastal areas in the Mediterranean, the Corsica Island is under an increasing pressure from the combined effects of climate change, population growth, agriculture, and tourism. Then, surface and groundwater flows can also become sources of pollutants and contaminants, linking GDEs to all human activities in the catchment area, and increasing GDEs qualitative vulnerability. In this context, the Summer School aims at giving key scientific concepts and practical tools to increase and disseminate knowledge on GDEs functioning, and rise innovative ideas for a sustainable use and management combining both natural and social sciences.More broadly, the Summer School will offer a unique opportunity tovcombine foundational and applied geological knowledge with interdisciplinary learning, enhance field and lab skills, explore academic pathways at UCPP and UNIPI, connect research with professional opportunities, engage in language practice and cultural exchange, expand international networks, and promote lifelong learning. The Summer School is jointly organised by the University of Pisa (UNIPI, Italy) and the University of Corsica Pascal Paoli (UCPP, Corsica, France).It is chaired by Prof. Viviana Re and Dr. Maria di Rosa (UNIPI), Prof. Sebastien Santoni and Dr. Thomas Leydier (UNICPP), with the help of Dr. Stefano Viaroli (UNIPI), Dr. Emilie Garel, Prof. Frederic Huneau, Prof. Vanina Pasqualini and with the support of the University of Corsica Pascal Paoli. Students will be hosted at the University of Corsica, Corte, France. To learn more about the University of Corsica Pascal Paoli please check the following website, brochure and video. The Summer School will be articulated in 5 days, according to the program available for download at the bottom of the webpage. Aim The interdisciplinary summer school proposes a novel and integrated approach to understand the past, present, and future of water resources through the lens of structural geology, geochemistry, and socio-hydrogeology. Thanks to hands-on field and laboratory experiences the summer school will provide participants an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of the main disciplines necessary to characterize water quality and quantity and to translate this information into management proposals for the long-term protection of this resource. After the course participants will be able to plan integrated monitoring assessment, use in situ monitoring probes, correctly store and preserve samples for chemical and isotopic analyses. Participants will learn to identify the main geological structures in the study area, collect and store samples and deepen their understanding of water-rock interaction processes in wetlands and Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs).

The Mediterranean basin hosts numerous inland and coastal GDE. However – despite their uniqueness – they are increasingly subject to anthropogenic pressures, resulting in degradation of their natural properties. These threats include both shortlived processes (e.g. over pumping and contamination) and long-term ones (e.g. climate change) and require sound scientific knowledge to implement sustainable protection measures.For this reason, the Summer School will cover different topics necessary to better asses the intricate relationships between the geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere, for a comprehensive characterization of GDEs, including: Hydrogeochemistry (gas and physicochemical parameters): to evaluate groundwater natural composition and assess deviations from natural baseline values; Structural geology: to better assess the geometry of groundwater flow path; Isotope hydrology: to trace groundwater recharge processes and age; Hydrogeology: to identify groundwater flow paths and support geochemical pieces of evidence on water-rock interaction and mixing processes with surface water to complement vulnerability assessments; Socio-hydrogeology: to assess the socio-economic impact of mineral and thermal waters, and to understand how to effectively translate scientific outcomes to the water users; Ecology: to analyse biodiversity and ecological processes towards innovative solutions for GDEs restoration, combining both natural and social sciences. The school will take place in Corsica, a unique place for testing integrated approaches, characterized by the presence of a multi-composite geological and hydroclimatic context, giving origin to various GDEs.Indeed, as a Mediterranean mountainous Island, the Corsica is well known as a biodiversity and geo-diversity hotspot, hosting 220 Km² of wetlands and GDEs: coastal lagoons, alluvial wetlands, river banks and mouths, temporary ponds, low and high-altitude peatlands. Most of them are of high heritage value, and 5 of them are listed as RAMSAR sites: Biguglia, Urbino, the Palo coastal lagoons, the Tre Padule de Suartone temporary pond, and the Moltifao peatland. Even if Corsica’s wetlands appear obviously groundwater-dependent considering the Mediterranean hydroclimate context, recent scientific publications allowed a better characterization and quantification of catchment water balance components supplying Corsican GDEs over time and space. Integrated geological and environmental tools are very interesting when used together because they can provide information on water origins and chemical properties, as well as an estimation of the timing of the hydroecological processes. Especially, considering the steep relief and geology diversity of the Corsica Island, environmental stable and radioactive natural tracers seem well adapted for functional and qualitative assessment of hydrological fluxes supplying GDEs. Like many coastal areas in the Mediterranean, the Corsica Island is under an increasing pressure from the combined effects of climate change, population growth, agriculture, and tourism. Then, surface and groundwater flows can also become sources of pollutants and contaminants, linking GDEs to all human activities in the catchment area, and increasing GDEs qualitative vulnerability. In this context, the Summer School aims at giving key scientific concepts and practical tools to increase and disseminate knowledge on GDEs functioning, and rise innovative ideas for a sustainable use and management combining both natural and social sciences.More broadly, the Summer School will offer a unique opportunity tovcombine foundational and applied geological knowledge with interdisciplinary learning, enhance field and lab skills, explore academic pathways at UCPP and UNIPI, connect research with professional opportunities, engage in language practice and cultural exchange, expand international networks, and promote lifelong learning.

In terms of accommodation, students usually find housing through the city's many estate agents or by checking out postings placed on notice boards in each of the University's departments. Students often share an apartment with other Italian or international students. The cost of renting a room is roughly 250.00/400.00 euros per month excluding the cost of utilities and the individual share of general expenses for the building's maintenance. DSU Toscana (Regional Agency for the Right of Study) offers accommodation to students who win the DSU scholarship. For more information, please read art. 18 of the call for application.  ♦ When to start looking for an accommodation To look for an accommodation in Pisa could be challenging, especially if you arrive when lessons already started. The International Office cannot help you finding an accommodation but can support you with information about dedicated portals and websites. We strongly recommend you begin your searching quite early and book an accommodation well in advance (before your arrival). We suggest you that the right time to book an accommodation in Pisa is in summertime, namely June and July. This is the time when most of the students leave the city for Summer holidays and rooms are available for renting. For a more detailed list of accommodation in Pisa, please consult our guide, attached at the bottom of this page. ♦ Safestay Hostel They offer special discounts for Unipi students as you can see in the flyer attached at the bottom of this page. To book a room, please, visit Safestay Hostel website. Plus, you can consult the Comune of Pisa's website Walking in the City to find a complete list of accommodation (for a short period of stay) and facilities.  ♦ HousingAnywhere To book your accommodation in Pisa before your arrival, University of Pisa recommends HousingAnywhere, the international housing platform for mobile talents. Through HousingAnywhere you can safely book your new room, offered by verified private landlords and by outgoing students. To receive a 20% discount on the booking fee, a University of Pisa VIP profile and priority access to the listings, sign up here. NB: First you will have to pay the entire price and then e-mail Questo indirizzo email è protetto dagli spambots. È necessario abilitare JavaScript per vederlo. // to have that amount back. You can find information about finding your new place on the how it works page. Do you need more information or have a specific question? Send an e-mail to Questo indirizzo email è protetto dagli spambots.

It is funded by the Regione Toscana and the ARDSU (the Regional Programme for the \"Right to Study\"). It is a web-based application where you can find single or shared rooms and flats.”  ♦ What do you need to know when signing a rental agreement for a private accommodation Carefully review the rental agreement for a private accommodation (single or double room and studio). When you visit the apartments, check if the price they ask you is consistent with the settled price and make sure you are clear on all the services and household items the rent includes. For example, is the cost of bills inclued or not? Are there any extra costs? Is the washing machine available? Remember that landlords will ask you to pay a deposit (usually is equal to 2 o 3 monthly rent). To be sure that you do not forget anything, note down all the details and, when it comes the signing step, check both price and rental conditions in the contract have remained the same.", "lang": "en"}, "1343": {"doclen": 211, "url": "https://www.unipi.it/index.php/facilities", "title": "Facilities", "description": "", "lang": "en"}, "1344": {"doclen": 294, "url": "https://www.unipi.it/index.php/facilities/item/2311-meals", "title": "Meals", "description": "The University of Pisa offers a low-price dining service to students through the Diritto allo Studio Universitario (DSU Toscana) agency.

The transfer into university study can therefore be daunting and some students may find themselves confronted by certain problems. We want our students to have the most fulfilling and pleasant university experience possible, and so, for this reason, the University of Pisa runs a counselling service (\"Servizio di Ascolto e Consulenza\") which is offered to all students. This service is available to those that want to resolve any specific issues or simply talk to someone. Who can use the service? The counselling service is aimed at students who are struggling to deal with any problems linked to their university experience, for instance issues relating to: Adapting to university study and life; Time management and organisation of study methods; Relationships with colleagues and professors; Concentration, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness and lack of motivation. Purposes of the service The purpose of this service is to provide students with the help and support of experienced and qualified professionals, who will help them to understand, confront and overcome their difficulties by: Providing a listening space where students can feel at ease; Developing appropriate strategies to help students manage any discomforts regarding their university experience; Helping students to discover ways of handling their problems in an independent manner. Organisation of the service Students interested in these support services can choose to receive either individual support or group support. Individual support involves attending a short series of 45-minute sessions hosted by one of our professionals. During these meetings, our professional counsellors will listen to any concerns communicated by our students and then identify ways of dealing with these issues. They will provide effective support and encourage students to become more self-aware. Group support involves attending 8 weekly 90-minute sessions. During these meetings, different coping strategies will be discussed, including ways of: handling anxiety, easing emotional discomfort, improving social and interpersonal skills and generally supporting psychological well-being in order to have a better quality of life. How can I book an appointment? Students who are interested in getting involved must first complete a brief online questionnaire, in order to evaluate which type of support (individual or group) is most suitable for them. Students will receive an email with details of the recommended route based on the questionnaire results, and information on booking an appointment.
